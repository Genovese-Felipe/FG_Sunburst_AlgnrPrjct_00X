It defines how the data is stored,\\nmanaged, and retrieved from a database. It defines the relationship between different entities in a database and determines\\nthe constraints for security purposes. Some important types of data architecture are given here.\\nClient-server database architecture\\nDistributed database architecture\\nCloud database architecture\\xa0\\nCentralised database architecture\\nThe type of database to be chosen depends on the requirements of the project at hand, the amount of data stored,\\naccessibility, performance and others.\\nDatabase Three Schema Architecture\\nIn a DBMS, the data architecture is divided into three major types.\\xa0\\n1. Tier I\\nThe tier I database architecture is directly available to the user. Any change in the data will be done on the database itself.\\nHere, the programmers directly communicate with the database for local applications such as those from colleges, private\\nfirms, etc.\\xa0\\n2. Tier II\\nThe Tier II database architecture is not directly available to the user. Still, they can communicate via an application on the\\nclient end, which connects with the database on the server side. The user interface and application program run on the client\\nside.\\nBanks are the real-world example of a Tier II database architecture. The database in Tier II can be accessed through APIs,\\nsuch as JDBC, ODBC, etc.\\n3. Tier III\\nIn Tier III database architecture, there is a third layer between client and server. A client cannot communicate directly with\\nthe server. However, applications on the client side interact with an application server to communicate with the database.\\ndata architecture\\nThe user at the client end has yet to learn about the existence of a database beyond the application server. They are usually\\nemployed for large web applications.\\nWhat Is Database In SQL\\nA database in SQL is a collection of tables which store data in an organised manner. We use SQL, which allows users to\\ninteract with the data using various SQL commands. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to\\nmanipulate or manage the relational database using SQL commands.

What is an SQL index?\\nTalking about the history of SQL, it traces its origins back to the early 1970s, when IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlin\\nand Raymond F. Boyce developed ‚ÄúSEQUEL‚Äù ‚Äì A Structured English Query Language.\\xa0\\nThe goal was to create a standardized language that can manage and retrieve data stored in relational databases. SEQUEL\\nwas initially designed to work with IBM‚Äôs System R, one of the first prototypes of a relational database management system\\n(RDBMS).\\nIn 1979, SQL‚Äôs commercial potential became apparent, and the first SQL-based RDBMS, Oracle, was released by the Oracle\\nCorporation. Over the years, SQL became the standard language for interacting with relational databases, with its first\\nstandardization occurring in 1986 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and later by the International\\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.\\nSince then, SQL has evolved with various updates and extensions, maintaining its status as the dominant database language.\\nIt has remained foundational to modern data management systems, with widespread adoption across different industries,\\nfrom finance to healthcare, cementing its importance in the history of computing.\\nSQL Commands\\nSQL (Structured Query Language) commands play an important role in manipulating and managing relational databases,\\noffering plenty of functionalities to interact with data effectively. Let us explore some key SQL commands and their\\nfunctionalities in detail:\\nImage Source\\n1) SQL SELECT\\nFunctionality: It enables users to retrieve specific data or entire datasets from a set of multiple tables based on\\nspecified criteria.\\nUsage: It is often employed for generating reports, extracting insights, and performing data analysis by filtering and\\nselecting relevant data subsets.\\nSyntax Example\\nSELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE category = ‚ÄòElectronics‚Äô;\\xa0\\n2) SQL CREATE\\nFunctionality: It helps in the creation of databases, tables, indexes, and other database objects.\\nUsage: Essential for database administrators and developers to define the structure, relationships, and constraints of\\ndatabase objects.\\nExample For Creating a Table\\nCREATE TABLE Customers ( customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_name VARCHAR(50), email VARCHAR(100) );\\n3) SQL DELETE\\nFunctionality: It removes specific records or rows from a table based on specified conditions.\\nUsage: This hels in data cleanup, removal of obsolete records, and maintenance of database integrity.\\nExample of Deleting a particular Order Data From Order Column\\nDELETE FROM Orders WHERE order_date < ‚Äò2022-01-01‚Äô;\\xa0\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\n4) SQL INSERT INTO\\nFunctionality: Inserts new records or rows into a table with specified column values.\\nUsage: Essential for adding new data entries, updating catalogs, and maintaining up-to-date information within tables.\\nExample Of Inserting a New Record into products table\\nINSERT INTO Products (product_name, price) VALUES (‚ÄòLaptop‚Äô, 1200);\\xa0\\n5) SQL UPDATE\\nFunctionality: Modifies existing records or rows within a table based on specified conditions.\\nUsage: Facilitates data modification, correction of errors, and updating records to reflect changes in business\\nprocesses or requirements.\\nExample Of Updating Department Of An Employee\\nUPDATE Employees SET department = ‚ÄòIT‚Äô WHERE employee_id = 101;\\xa0\\n6) SQL JOIN\\nFunctionality: Combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns to retrieve data in a unified result\\nset.\\nUsage: Enables data integration, relationship establishment between tables, and extraction of comprehensive\\ndatasets.\\nExample Of Combining Customer Record\\nSELECT Orders.order_id, Customers.customer_name FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id =\\nCustomers.customer_id;\\xa0\\n7) SQL DROP\\nFunctionality: Eliminates existing databases, tables, views, indexes, or other database objects.\\nUsage: Essential for database maintenance, restructuring, and removal of redundant or obsolete objects.\\nExample Of Eliminating a Table if Different One Exists\\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;\\xa0\\nHow Does SQL Work?\\nStructured Query Language operates as a powerful tool for managing and handling data in relational databases.\\nUnderstanding how SQL works involves diving into its core functionalities, components, and operations. Here is an overview\\nof how SQL works:\\n1) Definition and Structure\\nSQL serves as a standardized programming language designed specifically for managing relational databases. It encompasses\\na structured syntax comprising various statements, commands, and clauses tailored for data definition, manipulation,\\nretrieval, and control.\\n2) Database Creation and Design\\nSQL enables users to define the logical structure of databases, including tables, relationships, constraints, indexes, views, and\\nschemas. Database administrators and developers utilize SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands like CREATE,\\nALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE to create and modify database objects.\\n3) Data Manipulation\\nSQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands facilitate the insertion, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data\\nwithin tables. Commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE empower users to interact with database records,\\napply filters, sort data, and perform aggregate functions.\\n4) Data Retrieval and Querying\\nSQL excels in retrieving specific data subsets from vast databases through structured queries. The SELECT statement serves\\nas a cornerstone for formulating queries, enabling users to extract, filter, and aggregate data based on specified criteria,\\nconditions, and relationships.\\n5) Data Integrity and Constraints\\nSQL helps in promoting data integrity through the implementation of constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, unique\\nconstraints, not null constraints, and check constraints. These constraints enforce rules, relationships, and validations within\\ntables, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and reliability.\\n6) Transaction Management\\nSQL Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands facilitate transaction management, ensuring data consistency and\\nreliability. Commands such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT enable users to manage transaction boundaries, roll\\nback erroneous operations, and maintain database integrity despite system failures or interruptions.\\n7) Optimization and Performance\\nSQL provides mechanisms to optimize database performance through data modeling, indexing, query optimization,\\nexecution plans, and performance tuning. Database administrators leverage tools, techniques, and best practices to enhance\\nquery execution, reduce response times, and optimize resource utilization.\\n8) Security and Access Control\\nSQL incorporates robust security mechanisms to safeguard sensitive data, restrict unauthorized access, and ensure\\ncompliance with regulatory standards. SQL Data Control Language (DCL) commands like GRANT and REVOKE enable\\nadministrators to define user privileges, roles, and permissions, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\\nComponents of SQL System\\nSQL systems are an important part of relational database management which includes distinct components that help in\\nfacilitating efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. Let us dive further into the topic to see what are these integral\\ncomponents of SQL systems:\\n1) SQL Schema\\nDefinition: An SQL schema represents the logical structure, design, and organization of the database, defining tables,\\nfields, relationships, constraints, and more.\\nExample: In designing an e-commerce platform, an SQL schema might include tables such as Users, Products, Orders,\\nand Payments, outlining their respective attributes and relationships.\\n2) Indexes\\nDefinition: Indexes enhance database performance by accelerating data retrieval operations. They provide quick\\naccess to specific data within a table, reducing the time required for query execution.\\nExample: A unique index on the User_ID column within the Users table ensures rapid retrieval of user-specific data,\\noptimizing system responsiveness.\\n3) Constraints\\nDefinition: Constraints impose rules and conditions on data columns within tables, ensuring data integrity,\\nconsistency, and accuracy. Common constraints include primary keys, foreign keys, unique, not null, and check\\nconstraints.\\nExample: A foreign key constraint linking the Order_ID column in the Orders table to the User_ID column in the Users\\ntable maintains referential integrity between related data entities.\\n4) Triggers\\nDefinition: Triggers are specialized stored procedures that automatically execute in response to specific events or\\nactions within the database, such as data modifications, insertions, or deletions.\\nExample: A trigger might activate upon the insertion of a new record into the Payments table, automatically updating\\nthe Total_Sales column in the Analytics table.\\n5) Views\\nDefinition: Views present a virtual representation of data derived from one or multiple tables, tailored to meet\\nspecific user requirements or application needs. They simplify complex queries, enhance data security, and provide a\\ncustomizable perspective of the database.\\nExample: A view named High_Value_Customers might aggregate data from the Users and Orders tables, displaying\\ninformation solely about customers with a purchase history exceeding a specified value.\\n6) Transactions\\nDefinition: Transactions encapsulate a sequence of SQL operations, ensuring data consistency, reliability, and\\natomicity. Transactions adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data\\nintegrity despite system failures or interruptions.\\nExample: A banking application might employ transactions to ensure that fund transfers between accounts occur\\natomically, maintaining accurate account balances and transaction histories.\\n7) Backup and Recovery\\nDefinition: Backup and recovery mechanisms safeguard critical database information, enabling data restoration in the\\nevent of system failures, errors, or disasters. SQL systems offer robust backup strategies, including full, differential,\\nand incremental backups, coupled with recovery options to mitigate data loss risks.\\nExample: Regularly scheduled backups of an e-commerce database ensure the availability of historical data,\\ntransaction records, and customer information, facilitating rapid recovery and continuity in unforeseen circumstances.\\nAlso read: SQL For Data Analytics: A Comprehensive Guide\\nAlso read: SQL vs NoSQL: 5 Critical Differences You Should Know\\nSQL Injection\\nSQL injection (SQLi) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can insert or ‚Äúinject‚Äù malicious SQL code\\ninto a query, thereby gaining unauthorized access to a database or executing unintended commands. SQL injection attacks\\npose significant risks to web applications and databases, potentially compromising sensitive data, breaching confidentiality,\\nintegrity, and availability.\\nWhat is MySQL?\\nMySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for\\nmanaging and manipulating data within databases. Developed by MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation, MySQL is\\nwidely used for various applications, websites, and enterprise solutions due to its scalability, performance, reliability, and\\ncost-effectiveness.

How do Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing differ from one another?\\n1.3.11. 26. What distinguishes descriptive statistics from inferential statistics?\\n1.3.12. 27. Describe the machine learning notion of overfitting.\\n1.3.13. 28. What distinguishes supervised from unsupervised learning?\\n1.3.14. 29. What do you understand by Cross-Validation?\\n1.3.15. 30. How can we use Excel in data analysis?\\n1.3.16. 31. In Excel, how do you make a pivot table?\\n1.3.17. 32. What does Excel conditional formatting mean?\\nThe answer is that relational databases are managed and worked on using the computer language SQL (Structured Query\\nLanguage). It is crucial for data analysis because it enables analysts to extract, alter, and analyze data, run complicated\\nqueries, and aggregate and summarize data for reporting and analytical needs.\\n6. In SQL, how do INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN differ from one another?\\nAn inner join only returns rows with matching values in the two connected tables, as opposed to an outer join, which returns\\nall rows from one table and matching rows from the other. OUTER JOIN can be further broken down into the subcategories\\nof LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, depending on whether the table‚Äôs data is included.\\n7. How can you use SQL to search for duplicate records in a table?\\nThe GROUP BY and HAVING clauses may be used to identify duplicate data. Here is a sample inquiry:\\nSELECT column1, column2, COUNT() FROM table_name GROUP BY column1, column2, AND COUNT() > 1 IN column1,\\ncolumn2.\\nBased on the chosen columns, duplicate records will be shown.\\n8. What do the terms ‚Äúprimary key‚Äù and ‚Äúforeign key‚Äù mean in SQL?\\nA primary key is a special code that distinguishes each entry in a database. It guarantees data integrity and enables speedy\\ndata retrieval. A field in a table that relates to the primary key of another table is regarded as a foreign key. By creating a\\nconnection between the two tables, it ensures referential integrity.\\n9. Describe the differences between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL.\\nIn contrast to UNION ALL, which combines the result sets without deleting duplicate rows, UNION combines the result sets\\nof two or more SELECT queries. Because it doesn‚Äôt do the duplicate removal procedure, UNION ALL is quicker than UNION.\\n10. Why does data visualization matter while analyzing data?\\nThe ability to clearly and concisely explain complicated data insights is one of the reasons data visualization is crucial. Thanks\\nto visual representations, stakeholders may more quickly comprehend trends, patterns, and correlations within the data,\\nwhich improves decision-making.\\n11. What is the importance of color in Data Visualisation?\\nIn data visualization, color is a potent tool. It can be applied to emphasize certain data points, show patterns and trends,\\nrepresent several categories or variables, or generate visual contrast. However, it‚Äôs crucial to utilize color carefully, keeping in\\nmind accessibility and preventing color blindness-related misunderstandings.\\n12. Which methods are most successful for producing compelling data\\nvisualizations?\\nThe use of appropriate titles and labels, context and concise explanations, effective use of color to highlight important\\ninformation, appropriate scaling, and making sure the visualization is aesthetically pleasing and simple to understand are\\nsome best practices for producing successful data visualizations.\\n13. What is Tableau, and how does it function while analyzing data?\\nData Analysts may generate dynamic and aesthetically pleasing dashboards, reports, and charts using the sophisticated data\\nvisualization and business intelligence platform Tableau. Users may do data blending and transformation, connect to a variety\\nof data sources, and create visualizations to produce insights.\\n14. In Tableau, how do you construct a calculated field?\\nIn Tableau, you can create a calculated field by right-clicking on the data pane, choosing ‚ÄúCreate Calculated Field,‚Äù and then\\nspecifying the calculation in the formula editor. You may calculate using pre-existing fields or unique formulas to gain fresh\\ninsights thanks to calculated fields.\\n15. What are the differences between Tableau‚Äôs dimensions and measures?\\nFor example, client names or product categories are categorical variables known as dimensions in Tableau. On the other\\nhand, measures are quantitative or numerical variables that reflect facts that may be combined, such as sales revenue or\\nprofit. Measures are often used for computations and aggregation, whereas dimensions are frequently used for grouping and\\ncategorization.\\n16. In Tableau, how do you make a dual-axis chart?\\nTo make a dual-axis chart, you may drag two measures onto the ‚ÄúColumns‚Äù or ‚ÄúRows‚Äù shelf. Select ‚ÄúDual Axis‚Äù from the menu\\nby performing a right-click on one of the measurements. This enables more meaningful visualizations by allowing you to\\ncompare two separate metrics on two different scales using common dimensions.\\n17. What does a Tableau parameter do, and how do you utilize it?\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nIn Tableau, a parameter is a user-defined input that enables interactive visualization, customization, and exploration. Users\\ncan dynamically change inputs or values to affect computations and filtering options. A list of values, a computed field, or a\\nrange of values can be used to generate parameters.\\n18. What exactly is a Tableau data extract?\\nA compressed, optimized subset of the data taken from the original data source is known as a Tableau data extract. It is kept\\nin Tableau‚Äôs exclusive format, which allows for quicker performance and effective data analysis. Data extracts are helpful\\nbecause they lessen the need for a live connection to the data source when dealing with big datasets or when offline access is\\nnecessary.\\n19. In Tableau, how do you make a dashboard?\\nIn Tableau, you can drag and drop spreadsheets, charts, and other items into the dashboard canvas to build a dashboard. After\\nthat, you may rearrange and resize these elements as well as add text, photos, filters, and interactive elements to provide a\\nunified and engaging display of the data. Multiple visualizations are aggregated into aesthetically pleasing dashboards.\\n20. In statistics, what distinguishes a population from a sample?\\nA whole collection of people, things, or events of interest are referred to as a population in statistics. You want to draw\\nconclusions about the entire group. On the other hand, a sample is a portion of the population. A smaller representative\\nsample of the population is used to make inferences or forecasts about the population as a whole.\\n21. The central limit theorem: what is it, and why is it significant?\\nThe central limit theorem predicts that as sample size rises, the sampling distribution of the sample means will resemble a\\nnormal distribution, independent of the form of the population distribution. This is significant because, under some\\ncircumstances, it enables us to draw conclusions about the population using sample data.\\n22. What distinguishes correlation from causation?\\nAn indication of how two variables fluctuate together statistically is referred to as correlation. It gauges the association‚Äôs\\nstrength and direction. On the other hand, causality indicates a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables,\\nshowing that changes in one variable directly affect changes in the other. Correlation does not prove causation because other\\nfactors or forces may be at play.\\n23, What does the p-value mean when testing a hypothesis?\\nThe likelihood of seeing a test statistic that is equally extreme or more extreme than the one derived from the sample data,\\ngiven the null hypothesis is correct, is known as the p-value. It aids in determining the results‚Äô statistical significance. The\\nresults are deemed statistically significant if the p-value is less than the preset significance threshold (for example, 0.05),\\nwhich shows evidence against the null hypothesis.\\n24. How do Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing differ from one\\nanother?\\nA Type I error in hypothesis testing happens in data science interview questions when the null hypothesis is disregarded even\\nif it is correct. It stands for a falsely positive finding. A Type II error, on the other hand, happens when the null hypothesis is\\naccepted despite being erroneous. It indicates a misleading negative outcome. As a result of the inverse relationship between\\nKind I and Type II errors, lowering one kind of error raises the probability of the other.\\n26. What distinguishes descriptive statistics from inferential statistics?\\nDescriptive statistics summarise and describe data using measurements like mean, median, standard deviation, and graphical\\nrepresentations. It strives to give a clear overview of the information. On the other hand, inferential statistics uses sample\\ndata to derive conclusions and inferences about the population as a whole. It employs methods like confidence intervals and\\nhypothesis testing.\\n27. Describe the machine learning notion of overfitting.\\nThis is known as overfitting when a machine learning model performs well on training data but poorly on new, untried data. It\\noccurs when a model grows overly complicated and begins to capture random fluctuations or noise in the training data rather\\nthan the underlying patterns. Techniques like regularization, cross-validation, or utilizing extra training data can all be used to\\nreduce overfitting.\\n28. What distinguishes supervised from unsupervised learning?\\nIn supervised learning, inputs are coupled with appropriate target labels, and the system is taught using labeled data. Based\\non the patterns discovered during training, the algorithm develops the ability to anticipate the labels of fresh, unused data.\\nThere are no goal labels in unsupervised learning. The program investigates the data without any specified outputs to\\ndiscover innate patterns, correlations, or clusters.\\n29. What do you understand by Cross-Validation?\\nA machine learning model‚Äôs performance and generalizability are assessed using the cross-validation approach. It entails\\ndividing the dataset into a number of subgroups or ‚Äúfolds.‚Äù A significant portion of the dataset is used to train the model, while\\nthe leftover is used to validation. This process has multiple iterations, with various subsets acting as the validation set. Cross-\\nvalidation aids in calculating the generalization error of the model and evaluating how well it performs on unknown data.\\n30. How can we use Excel in data analysis?\\nMicrosoft Excel is a popular spreadsheet program that enables users to arrange, examine, and work with data. Data entry,\\ncomputation, formatting, and visualization functions are available. Excel is used in data analysis to carry out operations such\\nas data cleansing, sorting, filtering, constructing formulae and functions, producing charts, and carrying out fundamental\\nstatistical analysis.\\n31. In Excel, how do you make a pivot table?\\nThe steps are as follow to construct a pivot table in Excel:\\nChoose the data set that you want to examine.\\nNavigate to the ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù tab and choose ‚ÄúPivotTable.‚Äù\\nChoose the pivot table‚Äôs range and placement in the dialogue box.\\nDrag and drag the pertinent fields to the values regions, rows, and columns.\\nMake necessary adjustments to the pivot table‚Äôs format, layout, and summary computations.\\n32. What does Excel conditional formatting mean?\\nThe function known as conditional formatting in Excel enables you to format cells in accordance with predefined criteria or\\nrules. It assists in graphically highlighting data that satisfy particular requirements. For instance, using conditional formatting,\\nyou may highlight duplicate cells, apply color scales based on cell values, or highlight cells with values over a specific\\nthreshold.\\n‚Üê Previous Post\\nNext Post ‚Üí\\nMust Read\\nAmazon Summer\\nInternship 2025 for Data\\nScientists ‚Äì An Effective\\nGuide\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 23, 2025\\nThe Summer Internship Program for\\nthe Year 2025 at Amazon: Your\\nGateway to a Data Scientist Career\\nAre you a‚Ä¶\\nData Labeling: What It Is,\\nHow It Works, and Why It\\nMatters in 2025\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 17, 2025\\nIn an age where the pot is really\\nboiling for all sorts of artificial\\nintelligence and machine-learning\\nterms, ‚Äúdata labeling‚Äù‚Ä¶\\nData Lake vs Data\\nWarehouse: Which One\\nShould You Choose in\\n2025?\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 16, 2025\\nToday, efficiency is crucial in\\nmanaging and storing data in the\\ndata-driven world; therefore, people\\nneed to learn how to‚Ä¶\\nData Science with Generative AI Course\\n‚Çπ20000\\nExplore\\nsupport@pwskills.com\\n\\uf0e0\\n+91 8448982581\\n\\uf879\\n\\uf08c\\n\\uf167\\n\\uf2c6\\nCompany\\nAbout us\\nFAQ\\nPrivacy policy\\nContact us\\nJob assistance\\nTerms and condition\\nProducts\\nPW Skills Lab\\nExperience Portal\\nHall Of fame\\nJob Portal\\nBecome an affiliate\\nBlog\\n'}, {'Bsc Data Science Syllabus Enrollment Future And Scope.pdf': 'Home ¬ª Data Science ¬ª Bsc Data Science Syllabus Enrollment Future and Scope\\nData Science\\nBsc Data Science Syllabus Enrollment Future and Scope\\nIn our modern-day Bsc Data Science rapid-paced surroundings, facts technology has proven to be a sport-changer; Data\\ntechnology has evolved into a hard vocation across sectors due to its ability to extract insights, expect tendencies, and\\nimpact decision-making.\\nWith its many uses and employment potentialities, information technological know-how has a shiny destiny.

This is because rule-\\nbased machine learning applies some form of learning algorithm such as Rough sets theory[7] to identify and minimise the set of features and to automatically identify useful rules, rather than a human needing to apply\\nprior domain knowledge to manually construct rules and curate a rule set.\\nRules typically take the form of an \\'{IF:THEN} expression\\', (e.g. {IF \\'condition\\' THEN \\'result\\'}, or as a more specific example, {IF \\'red\\' AND \\'octagon\\' THEN \\'stop-sign}). An individual rule is not in itself a model, since the rule\\nis only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Therefore rule-based machine learning methods typically comprise a set of rules, or knowledge base, that collectively make up the prediction model usually known as\\ndecision algorithm. Rules can also be interpreted in various ways depending on the domain knowledge, data types(discrete or continuous) and in combinations.\\nRepeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (RIPPER) is a propositional rule learner proposed by William W.

It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some\\nmeasures of interestingness.[1] In any given transaction with a variety of items, association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected.\\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli≈Ñski and Arun Swami[2] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-\\nof-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule \\n found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are\\nlikely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.\\nIn addition to the above example from market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and\\nbioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\\nThe association rule algorithm itself consists of various parameters that can make it difficult for those without some expertise in data mining to execute, with many rules that are arduous to understand.[3]\\nA Venn Diagram to show the associations\\nbetween itemsets X and Y of a dataset. All\\ntransactions that contain item X are located\\nin the white, left portion of the circle, while\\nthose containing Y are colored red and on\\nthe right. Any transaction containing both X\\nand Y are located in the middle and are\\ncolored pink. Multiple concepts can be used\\nto depict information from this graph. For\\nexample, if one takes all of the transactions\\nin the pink section and divided them by the\\ntotal amount of transactions (transactions\\ncontaining X (white) + transactions\\ncontaining Y(red)), the output would be\\nknown as the support. An instance of\\ngetting the result of a method known as the\\nconfidence, one can take all of the\\ntransactions in the middle (pink) and divide\\nthem by all transactions that contain Y (red\\nand pink). In this case, Y is the antecedent\\nand X is the consequent.\\nFollowing the original definition by Agrawal, Imieli≈Ñski, Swami[2] the problem of association rule mining is defined as:\\nLet \\n be a set of n binary attributes called items.\\nLet \\n be a set of transactions called the database.\\nEach transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I.\\nA rule is defined as an implication of the form:\\n, where \\n.\\nIn Agrawal, Imieli≈Ñski, Swami[2] a rule is defined only between a set and a single item, \\n for \\n.\\nEvery rule is composed by two different sets of items, also known as itemsets, X and Y, where X is called antecedent or left-hand-side (LHS) and Y consequent or right-hand-side (RHS). The antecedent is that item that\\ncan be found in the data while the consequent is the item found when combined with the antecedent. The statement \\n is often read as if X then Y, where the antecedent (X ) is the if and the consequent (Y) is the\\nthen. This simply implies that, in theory, whenever X occurs in a dataset, then Y will as well.\\nAssociation rules are made by searching data for frequent if-then patterns and by using a certain criterion under Support and Confidence to define what the most important relationships are. Support is the evidence of\\nhow frequent an item appears in the data given, as Confidence is defined by how many times the if-then statements are found true. However, there is a third criteria that can be used, it is called Lift and it can be used to\\ncompare the expected Confidence and the actual Confidence. Lift will show how many times the if-then statement is expected to be found to be true.\\nAssociation rules are made to calculate from itemsets, which are created by two or more items. If the rules were built from the analyzing from all the possible itemsets from the data then there would be so many rules\\nthat they wouldn‚Äôt have any meaning. That is why Association rules are typically made from rules that are well represented by the data.\\nThere are many different data mining techniques you could use to find certain analytics and results, for example, there is Classification analysis, Clustering analysis, and Regression analysis.[4] What technique you\\nshould use depends on what you are looking for with your data. Association rules are primarily used to find analytics and a prediction of customer behavior. For Classification analysis, it would most likely be used to\\nquestion, make decisions, and predict behavior.[5] Clustering analysis is primarily used when there are no assumptions made about the likely relationships within the data.[5] Regression analysis Is used when you want to\\npredict the value of a continuous dependent from a number of independent variables.[5]\\nBenefits\\nThere are many benefits of using Association rules like finding the pattern that helps understand the correlations and co-occurrences between data sets. A very good real-world example that uses Association rules\\nwould be medicine. Medicine uses Association rules to help diagnose patients. When diagnosing patients there are many variables to consider as many diseases will share similar symptoms. With the use of the\\nAssociation rules, doctors can determine the conditional probability of an illness by comparing symptom relationships from past cases.[6]\\nDownsides\\nHowever, Association rules also lead to many different downsides such as finding the appropriate parameter and threshold settings for the mining algorithm. But there is also the downside of having a large number of\\ndiscovered rules. The reason is that this does not guarantee that the rules will be found relevant, but it could also cause the algorithm to have low performance. Sometimes the implemented algorithms will contain too\\nmany variables and parameters. For someone that doesn‚Äôt have a good concept of data mining, this might cause them to have trouble understanding it.[7]\\nThresholds\\nDefinition\\nProcess\\nTable 2.

Note that\\nlower levels of the lattice can contain at\\nmost the minimum number of their parents\\'\\nitems; e.g. {ac} can have only at most\\n items. This is called the\\ndownward-closure property.[2]\\nWhen using Association rules, you are most likely to only use Support and Confidence. However, this means you have to satisfy a user-specified minimum support and a user-specified minimum confidence at the same\\ntime. Usually, the Association rule generation is split into two different steps that needs to be applied:\\n1. A minimum Support threshold to find all the frequent itemsets that are in the database.\\n2. A minimum Confidence threshold to the frequent itemsets found to create rules.\\nTable 1. Example of Threshold for Support and\\nConfidence.\\nItems Support Confidence\\nItems Support Confidence\\nItem A 30%\\n50%\\nItem C 45%\\n55%\\nItem B 15%\\n25%\\nItem A 30%\\n50%\\nItem C 45%\\n55%\\nItem D 35%\\n40%\\nItem D 35%\\n40%\\nItem B 15%\\n25%\\nThe Support Threshold is 30%, Confidence Threshold is 50%\\nThe Table on the left is the original unorganized data and the table on the right is organized by the thresholds. In this case Item C is better than the thresholds for both Support and Confidence which is why it is first.\\nItem A is second because its threshold values are spot on. Item D has met the threshold for Support but not Confidence. Item B has not met the threshold for either Support or Confidence and that is why it is last.\\nTo find all the frequent itemsets in a database is not an easy task since it involves going through all the data to find all possible item combinations from all possible itemsets. The set of possible itemsets is the power\\nset over I and has size \\n , of course this means to exclude the empty set which is not considered to be a valid itemset. However, the size of the power set will grow exponentially in the number of item n that is\\nwithin the power set I. An efficient search is possible by using the downward-closure property of support[2][8] (also called anti-monotonicity[9]). This would guarantee that a frequent itemset and all its subsets are also\\nfrequent and thus will have no infrequent itemsets as a subset of a frequent itemset. Exploiting this property, efficient algorithms (e.g., Apriori[10] and Eclat[11]) can find all frequent itemsets.\\nTo illustrate the concepts, we use a small example from the supermarket domain. Table 2 shows a small database containing the items where, in each entry, the\\nvalue 1 means the presence of the item in the corresponding transaction, and the value 0 represents the absence of an item in that transaction. The set of items is\\n.\\nAn example rule for the supermarket could be \\n meaning that if butter and bread are bought, customers also buy milk.\\nIn order to select interesting rules from the set of all possible rules, constraints on various measures of significance and interest are used. The best-known\\nconstraints are minimum thresholds on support and confidence.\\nLet \\n be itemsets, \\n an association rule and T a set of transactions of a given database.\\nNote: this example is extremely small. In practical applications, a rule needs a support of several hundred transactions before it can be considered statistically\\nsignificant, and datasets often contain thousands or millions of transactions.\\nSupport\\nSupport is an indication of how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset.\\nIn our example, it can be easier to explain support by writing \\n[12] where A and B are separate item sets that occur at the same time in\\na transaction.\\nUsing Table 2 as an example, the itemset \\n has a support of 1/5=0.2 since it occurs in 20% of all transactions (1 out of 5 transactions). The argument of support of X is a set of preconditions, and\\nthus becomes more restrictive as it grows (instead of more inclusive).[13]\\nFurthermore, the itemset \\n has a support of 1/5=0.2 as it appears in 20% of all transactions as well.\\nWhen using antecedents and consequents, it allows a data miner to determine the support of multiple items being bought together in comparison to the whole data set. For example, Table 2 shows that if milk is bought,\\nthen bread is bought has a support of 0.4 or 40%. This because in 2 out 5 of the transactions, milk as well as bread are bought. In smaller data sets like this example, it is harder to see a strong correlation when there are\\nfew samples, but when the data set grows larger, support can be used to find correlation between two or more products in the supermarket example.\\nMinimum support thresholds are useful for determining which itemsets are preferred or interesting.\\nIf we set the support threshold to ‚â•0.4 in Table 3, then the \\n would be removed since it did not meet the minimum threshold of 0.4. Minimum threshold is used to remove samples where there is not a\\nstrong enough support or confidence to deem the sample as important or interesting in the dataset.\\nAnother way of finding interesting samples is to find the value of (support)√ó(confidence); this allows a data miner to see the samples where support and confidence are high enough to be highlighted in the dataset and\\nprompt a closer look at the sample to find more information on the connection between the items.\\nSupport can be beneficial for finding the connection between products in comparison to the whole dataset, whereas confidence looks at the connection between one or more items and another item. Below is a table\\nthat shows the comparison and contrast between support and support √ó confidence, using the information from Table 4 to derive the confidence values.\\nUseful Concepts\\nTable 3. Example of Support, and support √ó confidence\\nif Antecedent then Consequent\\nsupport\\nsupport X confidence\\nif buy milk, then buy bread\\n2/5= 0.4\\n0.4√ó1.0= 0.4\\nif buy milk, then buy eggs\\n1/5= 0.2\\n0.2√ó0.5= 0.1\\nif buy bread, then buy fruit\\n2/5= 0.4\\n0.4√ó0.66= 0.264\\nif buy fruit, then buy eggs\\n2/5= 0.4\\n0.4√ó0.66= 0.264\\nif buy milk and bread, then buy fruit 2/5= 0.4\\n0.4√ó1.0= 0.4\\nThe support of X with respect to T is defined as the proportion of transactions in the dataset which contains the itemset X. Denoting a transaction by \\n where i is the unique identifier of the transaction and t is its\\nitemset, the support may be written as:\\nThis notation can be used when defining more complicated datasets where the items and itemsets may not be as easy as our supermarket example above. Other examples of where support can be used is in finding\\ngroups of genetic mutations that work collectively to cause a disease, investigating the number of subscribers that respond to upgrade offers, and discovering which products in a drug store are never bought\\ntogether.[12]\\nConfidence\\nConfidence is the percentage of all transactions satisfying X that also satisfy Y.[14]\\nWith respect to T, the confidence value of an association rule, often denoted as \\n, is the ratio of transactions containing both X and Y to the total amount of X values present, where X is the antecedent and Y is\\nthe consequent.\\nConfidence can also be interpreted as an estimate of the conditional probability\\n, the probability of finding the RHS of the rule in transactions under the condition that these transactions also contain the\\nLHS.[13][15]\\nIt is commonly depicted as:\\nThe equation illustrates that confidence can be computed by calculating the co-occurrence of transactions X and Y within the dataset in ratio to transactions containing only X. This means that the number of\\ntransactions in both X and Y is divided by those just in X .\\nFor example, Table 2 shows the rule \\n which has a confidence of \\n in the dataset, which denotes that every time a customer buys butter and bread, they also buy milk.\\nThis particular example demonstrates the rule being correct 100% of the time for transactions containing both butter and bread. The rule \\n, however, has a confidence of \\n. This\\nsuggests that eggs are bought 67% of the times that fruit is brought. Within this particular dataset, fruit is purchased a total of 3 times, with two of those times consisting of egg purchases.\\nFor larger datasets, a minimum threshold, or a percentage cutoff, for the confidence can be useful for determining item relationships. When applying this method to some of the data in Table 2, information that does not\\nmeet the requirements are removed. Table 4 shows association rule examples where the minimum threshold for confidence is 0.5 (50%). Any data that does not have a confidence of at least 0.5 is omitted. Generating\\nthresholds allow for the association between items to become stronger as the data is further researched by emphasizing those that co-occur the most. The table uses the confidence information from Table 3 to\\nimplement the Support √ó Confidence column, where the relationship between items via their both confidence and support, instead of just one concept, is highlighted. Ranking the rules by Support √ó Confidence multiples\\nthe confidence of a particular rule to its support and is often implemented for a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between the items.\\nTable 4. Example of Confidence and Support √ó Confidence\\nif Antecedent then Consequent\\nConfidence\\nSupport √ó Confidence\\nif buy milk, then buy bread\\n2‚ÅÑ2 = 1.0\\n0.4√ó1.0= 0.4\\nif buy milk, then buy eggs\\n1‚ÅÑ2 = 0.5\\n0.2√ó0.5= 0.1\\nif buy bread, then buy fruit\\n2‚ÅÑ3 ‚âà 0.66\\n0.4√ó0.66= 0.264\\nif buy fruit, then buy eggs\\n2‚ÅÑ3 ‚âà 0.66\\n0.4√ó0.66= 0.264\\nif buy milk and bread, then buy fruit 2‚ÅÑ2 = 1.0\\n0.4√ó1.0= 0.4\\nOverall, using confidence in association rule mining is great way to bring awareness to data relations. Its greatest benefit is highlighting the relationship between particular items to one another within the set, as it\\ncompares co-occurrences of items to the total occurrence of the antecedent in the specific rule. However, confidence is not the optimal method for every concept in association rule mining. The disadvantage of using it\\nis that it does not offer multiple difference outlooks on the associations. Unlike support, for instance, confidence does not provide the perspective of relationships between certain items in comparison to the entire\\ndataset, so while milk and bread, for example, may occur 100% of the time for confidence, it only has a support of 0.4 (40%). This is why it is important to look at other viewpoints, such as Support √ó Confidence, instead\\nof solely relying on one concept incessantly to define the relationships.\\nLift\\nThe lift of a rule is defined as:\\nor the ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent.\\nFor example, the rule \\n has a lift of \\n.\\nIf the rule had a lift of 1, it would imply that the probability of occurrence of the antecedent and that of the consequent are independent of each other. When two events are independent of each other, no rule can be\\ndrawn involving those two events.\\nIf the lift is > 1, that lets us know the degree to which those two occurrences are dependent on one another, and makes those rules potentially useful for predicting the consequent in future data sets.\\nIf the lift is < 1, that lets us know the items are substitute to each other. This means that presence of one item has negative effect on presence of other item and vice versa.\\nThe value of lift is that it considers both the support of the rule and the overall data set.[13]\\n[rede]\\nConviction\\nThe conviction of a rule is defined as \\n.[16]\\nFor example, the rule \\n has a conviction of \\n, and can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule\\nmakes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. In this example, the conviction value of 1.2 shows that the rule \\nwould be incorrect 20% more often (1.2 times as often) if the association between X and Y was purely random chance.\\nAlternative measures of interestingness\\nIn addition to confidence, other measures of interestingness for rules have been proposed. Some popular measures are:\\nAll-confidence[17]\\nCollective strength[18]\\nLeverage[19]\\nSeveral more measures are presented and compared by Tan et al.[20] and by Hahsler.[21] Looking for techniques that can model what the user has known (and using these models as interestingness measures) is\\ncurrently an active research trend under the name of \"Subjective Interestingness.\"\\nThe concept of association rules was popularized particularly due to the 1993 article of Agrawal et al.,[2] which has acquired more than 23,790 citations according to Google Scholar, as of April 2021, and is thus one of\\nthe most cited papers in the Data Mining field. However, what is now called \"association rules\" is introduced already in the 1966 paper[22] on GUHA, a general data mining method developed by Petr H√°jek et al.[23]\\nAn early (circa 1989) use of minimum support and confidence to find all association rules is the Feature Based Modeling framework, which found all rules with \\n and \\n greater than user defined\\nconstraints.[24]\\nOne limitation of the standard approach to discovering associations is that by searching massive numbers of possible associations to look for collections of items that appear to be associated, there is a large risk of\\nfinding many spurious associations. These are collections of items that co-occur with unexpected frequency in the data, but only do so by chance. For example, suppose we are considering a collection of 10,000 items\\nand looking for rules containing two items in the left-hand-side and 1 item in the right-hand-side. There are approximately 1,000,000,000,000 such rules. If we apply a statistical test for independence with a significance\\nlevel of 0.05 it means there is only a 5% chance of accepting a rule if there is no association. If we assume there are no associations, we should nonetheless expect to find 50,000,000,000 rules. Statistically sound\\nassociation discovery[25][26] controls this risk, in most cases reducing the risk of finding any spurious associations to a user-specified significance level.\\nMany algorithms for generating association rules have been proposed.\\nSome well-known algorithms are Apriori, Eclat and FP-Growth, but they only do half the job, since they are algorithms for mining frequent itemsets. Another step needs to be done after to generate rules from frequent\\nitemsets found in a database.\\nApriori algorithm\\nApriori is given by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994 for frequent item set mining and association rule learning. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and\\nlarger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often. The name of the algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties.\\nThe control flow diagram for the Apriori algorithm\\nOverview: Apriori uses a \"bottom up\" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm\\nterminates when no further successful extensions are found. Apriori uses breadth-first search and a Hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates candidate item sets of length \\xa0from item sets\\nof length . Then it prunes the candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent -length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction\\ndatabase to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.\\nExample: Assume that each row is a cancer sample with a certain combination of mutations labeled by a character in the alphabet. For example a row could have {a, c} which means it is affected by mutation \\'a\\' and\\nmutation \\'c\\'.\\nInput Set\\n{a, b} {c, d} {a, d} {a, e} {b, d} {a, b, d} {a, c, d} {a, b, c, d}\\nNow we will generate the frequent item set by counting the number of occurrences of each character. This is also known as finding the support values. Then we will prune the item set by picking a minimum support\\nthreshold. For this pass of the algorithm we will pick 3.\\nSupport\\nValues\\na b c d\\n6 4 3 6\\nHistory\\nStatistically sound associations\\nAlgorithms\\nSince all support values are three or above there is no pruning. The frequent item set is {a}, {b}, {c}, and {d}. After this we will repeat the process by counting pairs of mutations in the input set.\\nSupport Values\\n{a, b} {a, c} {a, d} {b, c} {b, d} {c, d}\\n3\\n2\\n4\\n1\\n3\\n3\\nNow we will make our minimum support value 4 so only {a, d} will remain after pruning. Now we will use the frequent item set to make combinations of triplets. We will then repeat the process by counting occurrences\\nof triplets of mutations in the input set.\\nSupport\\nValues\\n{a, c, d}\\n2\\nSince we only have one item the next set of combinations of quadruplets is empty so the algorithm will stop.\\nAdvantages and Limitations:\\nApriori has some limitations. Candidate generation can result in large candidate sets. For example a 10^4 frequent 1-itemset will generate a 10^7 candidate 2-itemset. The algorithm also needs to frequently scan the\\ndatabase, to be specific n+1 scans where n is the length of the longest pattern. Apriori is slower than the Eclat algorithm. However, Apriori performs well compared to Eclat when the dataset is large. This is because in\\nthe Eclat algorithm if the dataset is too large the tid-lists become too large for memory. FP-growth outperforms the Apriori and Eclat. This is due to the FP-growth algorithm not having candidate generation or test, using\\na compact data structure, and only having one database scan.[27]\\nEclat algorithm\\nEclat[11] (alt. ECLAT, stands for Equivalence Class Transformation) is a backtracking algorithm, which traverses the frequent itemset lattice graph in a depth-first search (DFS) fashion. Whereas the breadth-first search\\n(BFS) traversal used in the Apriori algorithm will end up checking every subset of an itemset before checking it, DFS traversal checks larger itemsets and can save on checking the support of some of its subsets by\\nvirtue of the downward-closer property. Furthermore it will almost certainly use less memory as DFS has a lower space complexity than BFS.\\nTo illustrate this, let there be a frequent itemset {a, b, c}. a DFS may check the nodes in the frequent itemset lattice in the following order: {a} ‚Üí {a, b} ‚Üí {a, b, c}, at which point it is known that {b}, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c} all\\nsatisfy the support constraint by the downward-closure property. BFS would explore each subset of {a, b, c} before finally checking it. As the size of an itemset increases, the number of its subsets undergoes\\ncombinatorial explosion.\\nIt is suitable for both sequential as well as parallel execution with locality-enhancing properties.[28][29]\\nFP-growth algorithm\\nFP stands for frequent pattern.[30]\\nIn the first pass, the algorithm counts the occurrences of items (attribute-value pairs) in the dataset of transactions, and stores these counts in a \\'header table\\'. In the second pass, it builds the FP-tree structure by\\ninserting transactions into a trie.\\nItems in each transaction have to be sorted by descending order of their frequency in the dataset before being inserted so that the tree can be processed quickly. Items in each transaction that do not meet the minimum\\nsupport requirement are discarded. If many transactions share most frequent items, the FP-tree provides high compression close to tree root.\\nRecursive processing of this compressed version of the main dataset grows frequent item sets directly, instead of generating candidate items and testing them against the entire database (as in the apriori algorithm).\\nGrowth begins from the bottom of the header table i.e. the item with the smallest support by finding all sorted transactions that end in that item. Call this item .\\nA new conditional tree is created which is the original FP-tree projected onto . The supports of all nodes in the projected tree are re-counted with each node getting the sum of its children counts. Nodes (and hence\\nsubtrees) that do not meet the minimum support are pruned. Recursive growth ends when no individual items conditional on  meet the minimum support threshold. The resulting paths from root to  will be frequent\\nitemsets. After this step, processing continues with the next least-supported header item of the original FP-tree.\\nOnce the recursive process has completed, all frequent item sets will have been found, and association rule creation begins.[31]\\nOthers\\nASSOC\\nThe ASSOC procedure[32] is a GUHA method which mines for generalized association rules using fast bitstrings operations. The association rules mined by this method are more general than those output by apriori, for\\nexample \"items\" can be connected both with conjunction and disjunctions and the relation between antecedent and consequent of the rule is not restricted to setting minimum support and confidence as in apriori: an\\narbitrary combination of supported interest measures can be used.\\nOPUS search\\nOPUS is an efficient algorithm for rule discovery that, in contrast to most alternatives, does not require either monotone or anti-monotone constraints such as minimum support.[33] Initially used to find rules for a fixed\\nconsequent[33][34] it has subsequently been extended to find rules with any item as a consequent.[35] OPUS search is the core technology in the popular Magnum Opus association discovery system.\\nA famous story about association rule mining is the \"beer and diaper\" story. A purported survey of behavior of supermarket shoppers discovered that customers (presumably young men) who buy diapers tend also to\\nbuy beer. This anecdote became popular as an example of how unexpected association rules might be found from everyday data. There are varying opinions as to how much of the story is true.[36] Daniel Powers\\nsays:[36]\\nIn 1992, Thomas Blischok, manager of a retail consulting group at Teradata, and his staff prepared an analysis of 1.2 million market baskets from about 25 Osco Drug stores. Database\\nqueries were developed to identify affinities. The analysis \"did discover that between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. that consumers bought beer and diapers\". Osco managers did NOT exploit the\\nbeer and diapers relationship by moving the products closer together on the shelves.\\nLore\\nMulti-Relation Association Rules (MRAR): These are association rules where each item may have several relations. These relations indicate indirect relationships between the entities. Consider the following MRAR\\nwhere the first item consists of three relations live in, nearby and humid: ‚ÄúThose who live in a place which is nearby a city with humid climate type and also are younger than 20 \\n their health condition is good‚Äù. Such\\nassociation rules can be extracted from RDBMS data or semantic web data.[37]\\nContrast set learning is a form of associative learning. Contrast set learners use rules that differ meaningfully in their distribution across subsets.[38][39]\\nWeighted class learning is another form of associative learning where weights may be assigned to classes to give focus to a particular issue of concern for the consumer of the data mining results.\\nHigh-order pattern discovery facilitates the capture of high-order (polythetic) patterns or event associations that are intrinsic to complex real-world data. [40]\\nK-optimal pattern discovery provides an alternative to the standard approach to association rule learning which requires that each pattern appear frequently in the data.\\nApproximate Frequent Itemset mining is a relaxed version of Frequent Itemset mining that allows some of the items in some of the rows to be 0.[41]\\nGeneralized Association Rules hierarchical taxonomy (concept hierarchy)\\nQuantitative Association Rules categorical and quantitative data\\nInterval Data Association Rules e.g. partition the age into 5-year-increment ranged\\nSequential pattern mining discovers subsequences that are common to more than minsup (minimum support threshold) sequences in a sequence database, where minsup is set by the user. A sequence is an ordered\\nlist of transactions.[42]\\nSubspace Clustering, a specific type of clustering high-dimensional data, is in many variants also based on the downward-closure property for specific clustering models.[43]\\nWarmr, shipped as part of the ACE data mining suite, allows association rule learning for first order relational rules.[44]\\nSequence mining\\nProduction system (computer science)\\nLearning classifier system\\nRule-based machine learning\\n1.

Hahsler\\n'}, {'Apriori algorithm - Wikipedia.pdf': 'Apriori algorithm\\nApriori[1] is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and\\nlarger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the\\ndatabase: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.\\nThe Apriori algorithm was proposed by Agrawal and Srikant in 1994. Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions (for example, collections of items bought by customers, or details of a website\\nfrequentation or IP addresses[2]). Other algorithms are designed for finding association rules in data having no transactions (Winepi and Minepi), or having no timestamps (DNA sequencing). Each transaction is seen as\\na set of items (an itemset). Given a threshold \\n, the Apriori algorithm identifies the item sets which are subsets of at least \\n transactions in the database.\\nApriori uses a \"bottom up\" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates\\nwhen no further successful extensions are found.\\nApriori uses breadth-first search and a Hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates candidate item sets of length  from item sets of length \\n. Then it prunes the candidates which have\\nan infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent -length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the\\ncandidates.\\nThe pseudo code for the algorithm is given below for a transaction database \\n, and a support threshold of . Usual set theoretic notation is employed, though note that \\n is a multiset. \\n is the candidate set for level \\n. At each step, the algorithm is assumed to generate the candidate sets from the large item sets of the preceding level, heeding the downward closure lemma. \\n accesses a field of the data structure that\\nrepresents candidate set , which is initially assumed to be zero. Many details are omitted below, usually the most important part of the implementation is the data structure used for storing the candidate sets, and\\ncounting their frequencies.\\nApriori(T, Œµ)\\n    L1 ‚Üê {large singleton itemsets}\\n    k ‚Üê 2\\n    while Lk‚àí1 is not empty\\n        Ck ‚Üê Generate_candidates(Lk‚àí1, k)\\n        for transactions t in T\\n            Dt ‚Üê {c in Ck\\xa0: c ‚äÜ t}\\n            for candidates c in Dt\\n                count[c] ‚Üê count[c] + 1\\n        Lk ‚Üê {c in Ck\\xa0: count[c] ‚â• Œµ}\\n        k ‚Üê k + 1\\n    return Union(Lk) over all k\\n    \\nGenerate_candidates(L, k)\\n    result ‚Üê empty_set()\\n    for all p ‚àà L, q ‚àà L where p and q differ in exactly one element\\n        c ‚Üê p ‚à™ q\\n        if u ‚àà L for all u ‚äÜ c where |u| = k-1\\n            result.add(c)\\n    return result\\nExample 1\\nConsider the following database, where each row is a transaction and each cell is an individual item of the transaction:\\nŒ± Œ≤ Œµ\\nŒ± Œ≤ Œ∏\\nŒ± Œ≤ Œµ\\nŒ± Œ≤ Œ∏\\nThe association rules that can be determined from this database are the following:\\n1. 100% of sets with Œ± also contain Œ≤\\n2. 50% of sets with Œ±, Œ≤ also have Œµ\\n3. 50% of sets with Œ±, Œ≤ also have Œ∏\\nwe can also illustrate this through a variety of examples.\\nExample 2\\nAssume that a large supermarket tracks sales data by stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each item: each item, such as \"butter\" or \"bread\", is identified by a numerical SKU. The supermarket has a database of transactions\\nwhere each transaction is a set of SKUs that were bought together.\\nLet the database of transactions consist of following itemsets:\\nOverview\\nExamples\\nItemsets\\n{1,2,3,4}\\n{1,2,4}\\n{1,2}\\n{2,3,4}\\n{2,3}\\n{3,4}\\n{2,4}\\nWe will use Apriori to determine the frequent item sets of this database. To do this, we will say that an item set is frequent if it appears in at least 3 transactions of the database: the value 3 is the support threshold.\\nThe first step of Apriori is to count up the number of occurrences, called the support, of each member item separately. By scanning the database for the first time, we obtain the following result\\nItem Support\\n{1}\\n3\\n{2}\\n6\\n{3}\\n4\\n{4}\\n5\\nAll the itemsets of size 1 have a support of at least 3, so they are all frequent.\\nThe next step is to generate a list of all pairs of the frequent items.\\nFor example, regarding the pair {1,2}: the first table of Example 2 shows items 1 and 2 appearing together in three of the itemsets; therefore, we say item {1,2} has support of three.\\nItem Support\\n{1,2} 3\\n{1,3} 1\\n{1,4} 2\\n{2,3} 3\\n{2,4} 4\\n{3,4} 3\\nThe pairs {1,2}, {2,3}, {2,4}, and {3,4} all meet or exceed the minimum support of 3, so they are frequent. The pairs {1,3} and {1,4} are not. Now, because {1,3} and {1,4} are not frequent, any larger set which contains {1,3}\\nor {1,4} cannot be frequent. In this way, we can prune sets: we will now look for frequent triples in the database, but we can already exclude all the triples that contain one of these two pairs:\\nItem\\nSupport\\n{2,3,4} 2\\nin the example, there are no frequent triplets. {2,3,4} is below the minimal threshold, and the other triplets were excluded because they were super sets of pairs that were already below the threshold.\\nWe have thus determined the frequent sets of items in the database, and illustrated how some items were not counted because one of their subsets was already known to be below the threshold.\\nApriori, while historically significant, suffers from a number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned other algorithms. Candidate generation generates large numbers of subsets (The algorithm attempts to\\nload up the candidate set, with as many as possible subsets before each scan of the database). Bottom-up subset exploration (essentially a breadth-first traversal of the subset lattice) finds any maximal subset S only\\nafter all \\n of its proper subsets.\\nThe algorithm scans the database too many times, which reduces the overall performance. Due to this, the algorithm assumes that the database is permanently in the memory.\\nAlso, both the time and space complexity of this algorithm are very high: \\n, thus exponential, where \\n is the horizontal width (the total number of items) present in the database.\\nLater algorithms such as Max-Miner[3] try to identify the maximal frequent item sets without enumerating their subsets, and perform \"jumps\" in the search space rather than a purely bottom-up approach.\\n1.

Sequential pattern mining is a special case of structured data mining.\\nThere are several key traditional computational problems addressed within this field. These include building efficient databases and indexes for sequence information, extracting the frequently occurring patterns,\\ncomparing sequences for similarity, and recovering missing sequence members. In general, sequence mining problems can be classified as string mining which is typically based on string processing algorithms and\\nitemset mining which is typically based on association rule learning. Local process models [3] extend sequential pattern mining to more complex patterns that can include (exclusive) choices, loops, and concurrency\\nconstructs in addition to the sequential ordering construct.\\nString mining typically deals with a limited alphabet for items that appear in a sequence, but the sequence itself may be typically very long. Examples of an alphabet can be those in the ASCII character set used in\\nnatural language text, nucleotide bases \\'A\\', \\'G\\', \\'C\\' and \\'T\\' in DNA sequences, or amino acids for protein sequences. In biology applications analysis of the arrangement of the alphabet in strings can be used to examine\\ngene and protein sequences to determine their properties. Knowing the sequence of letters of a DNA or a protein is not an ultimate goal in itself. Rather, the major task is to understand the sequence, in terms of its\\nstructure and biological function. This is typically achieved first by identifying individual regions or structural units within each sequence and then assigning a function to each structural unit. In many cases this requires\\ncomparing a given sequence with previously studied ones. The comparison between the strings becomes complicated when insertions, deletions and mutations occur in a string.\\nA survey and taxonomy of the key algorithms for sequence comparison for bioinformatics is presented by Abouelhoda & Ghanem (2010), which include:[4]\\nRepeat-related problems: that deal with operations on single sequences and can be based on exact string matching or approximate string matching methods for finding dispersed fixed length and maximal length\\nrepeats, finding tandem repeats, and finding unique subsequences and missing (un-spelled) subsequences.\\nAlignment problems: that deal with comparison between strings by first aligning one or more sequences; examples of popular methods include BLAST for comparing a single sequence with multiple sequences in a\\ndatabase, and ClustalW for multiple alignments. Alignment algorithms can be based on either exact or approximate methods, and can also be classified as global alignments, semi-global alignments and local\\nalignment. See sequence alignment.\\nSome problems in sequence mining lend themselves to discovering frequent itemsets and the order they appear, for example, one is seeking rules of the form \"if a {customer buys a car}, he or she is likely to {buy\\ninsurance} within 1 week\", or in the context of stock prices, \"if {Nokia up and Ericsson up}, it is likely that {Motorola up and Samsung up} within 2 days\". Traditionally, itemset mining is used in marketing applications for\\ndiscovering regularities between frequently co-occurring items in large transactions. For example, by analysing transactions of customer shopping baskets in a supermarket, one can produce a rule which reads \"if a\\ncustomer buys onions and potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy hamburger meat in the same transaction\".\\nA survey and taxonomy of the key algorithms for item set mining is presented by Han et al. (2007).[5]\\nThe two common techniques that are applied to sequence databases for frequent itemset mining are the influential apriori algorithm and the more-recent FP-growth technique.\\nWith a great variation of products and user buying behaviors, shelf on which products are being displayed is one of the most important resources in retail environment. Retailers can not only increase their profit but, also\\ndecrease cost by proper management of shelf space allocation and products display. To solve this problem, George and Binu (2013) have proposed an approach to mine user buying patterns using PrefixSpan algorithm\\nand place the products on shelves based on the order of mined purchasing patterns.[6]\\nCommonly used algorithms include:\\nGSP algorithm\\nSequential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence classes (SPADE)\\nFreeSpan\\nPrefixSpan\\nMAPres[7]\\nSeq2Pat (for constraint-based sequential pattern mining)[8][9]\\nCollocation extraction\\xa0‚Äì Computational technique to find word sequences\\nProcess mining\\xa0‚Äì Data mining technique using event logs\\nSequence analysis\\xa0‚Äì Identification and study of genomic sequences\\nSequence analysis in social sciences\\xa0‚Äì Analysis of sets of categorical sequences\\nSequence clustering\\nSequence labeling\\n1.

The algorithms for solving sequence mining problems are mostly based on the apriori (level-wise) algorithm. One\\nway to use the level-wise paradigm is to first discover all the frequent items in a level-wise fashion. It simply means counting the occurrences of all singleton elements in the database. Then, the transactions are filtered\\nby removing the non-frequent items. At the end of this step, each transaction consists of only the frequent elements it originally contained. This modified database becomes an input to the GSP algorithm. This process\\nrequires one pass over the whole database.\\nGSP algorithm makes multiple database passes. In the first pass, all single items (1-sequences) are counted. From the frequent items, a set of candidate 2-sequences are formed, and another pass is made to identify\\ntheir frequency. The frequent 2-sequences are used to generate the candidate 3-sequences, and this process is repeated until no more frequent sequences are found. There are two main steps in the algorithm.\\nCandidate Generation. Given the set of frequent (k-1)-frequent sequences Fk-1, the candidates for the next pass are generated by joining F(k-1) with itself. A pruning phase eliminates any sequence, at least one of\\nwhose subsequences is not frequent.\\nSupport Counting. Normally, a hash tree‚Äìbased search is employed for efficient support counting. Finally non-maximal frequent sequences are removed.\\n   F1 = the set of frequent 1-sequence\\n   k=2,\\n   do while Fk-1\\xa0!= Null;\\n       Generate candidate sets Ck (set of candidate k-sequences);\\n       For all input sequences s in the database D\\n       do\\n           Increment count of all a in Ck if s supports a\\n       End do\\n       Fk = {a ‚àà Ck such that its frequency exceeds the threshold}\\n       k = k+1;\\n   End do\\n   Result = Set of all frequent sequences is the union of all Fk's\\nThe above algorithm looks like the Apriori algorithm. One main difference is however the generation of candidate sets. Let us assume that:\\nA ‚Üí B and A ‚Üí C\\nare two frequent 2-sequences. The items involved in these sequences are (A, B) and (A,C) respectively. The candidate generation in a usual Apriori style would give (A, B, C) as a 3-itemset, but in the present context we\\nget the following 3-sequences as a result of joining the above 2- sequences\\nA ‚Üí B ‚Üí C, A ‚Üí C ‚Üí B and A ‚Üí BC\\nThe candidate‚Äìgeneration phase takes this into account. The GSP algorithm discovers frequent sequences, allowing for time constraints such as maximum gap and minimum gap among the sequence elements.\\nMoreover, it supports the notion of a sliding window, i.e., of a time interval within which items are observed as belonging to the same event, even if they originate from different events.\\nSequence mining\\nR.

The classification procedure (x) converts a discrete output function (y) to an input variable.\\nNumerous issues can be solved using classification algorithms, such as image recognition, sentiment analysis, medical\\ndiagnosis, and spam email detection. The classification algorithm to be used is determined by the nature of the data as well as\\nthe specific requirements of the problem at hand, as different algorithms may perform better for different types of data and\\ntasks.\\nRecommended Course\\xa0\\n\\xa0Decode DSA with C++\\nFull Stack Data Science Pro Course\\xa0\\nJava For Cloud Course\\xa0\\nFull Stack Web Development Course\\nData Analytics Course\\xa0\\nLearners in Classification Problems\\nThere are two types of learners if we look at them thoroughly.\\nLazy Learners\\xa0\\nThe training dataset is first stored, and then it awaits the arrival of the test dataset. When employing a lazy learner, the\\nclassification is performed using the most relevant information from the training dataset. Prediction time is increased while\\ntraining time is decreased. Some examples include case-based reasoning and the KNN algorithm.\\nEager Learners\\nEager students construct a classification model using a training dataset before obtaining a test dataset. They devote more\\ntime to studying than forecasting. Examples include decision trees, naive Bayes, and ANN.\\nClassification Algorithms\\nYou can pick from a wide variety of classification algorithms. The application and type of the available data set must be\\nconsidered when choosing the best option.\\nDecision Tree\\nA decision tree algorithm is a well-known machine-learning technique that can be used for classification and regression tasks.\\nIt is a supervised learning algorithm that divides the dataset recursively into subsets based on the most significant attribute\\nor feature at each step. These splits form a tree-like structure, with each internal node representing a decision based on a\\nfeature, each branch representing an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node representing a class label or a numerical\\nvalue.\\nThe tree is built in a top-down, recursive, divide-and-conquer fashion. All attributes must be classified. Alternatively, they\\nshould be discretized ahead of time. Attributes at the top of the tree have a greater impact on classification and are identified\\nusing the concept of information gain.\\nNaive Bayes\\xa0\\nA straightforward and probabilistic machine learning algorithm called Naive Bayes is used for text classification and object\\nclassification.

When the conditional probability for a specific\\nattribute is zero, the prediction fails to be valid. This must be explicitly fixed with a Laplacian estimator.\\xa0\\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN)\\nArtificial neural networks, also known as ANNs, are a subset of machine learning algorithms used for various tasks, such as\\nclassification, regression, pattern recognition, and more. The term ‚ÄúArtificial Neural Networks‚Äù refers to a computational\\nmodel that was influenced by the composition and operation of the human brain.\\nThe model may have several hidden layers, depending on how complicated the function to be mapped is. These hidden layers\\ncan be used to model complex neural networks, like deep neural networks.\\xa0\\nHowever, when many hidden layers exist, training and adjusting the weights take a long time. Another disadvantage is that\\nthe model is difficult to interpret when compared to others, such as decision trees. This is because the learned weights have\\nan unknown symbolic meaning.\\nHowever, in most real-world applications, artificial neural networks have performed admirably. It can classify untrained\\npatterns and has a high tolerance for noisy data. Artificial neural networks typically perform better with continuous-valued\\ninputs and outputs.\\nK-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\\nKNN, which stands for ‚Äúk-Nearest Neighbors,‚Äù is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and\\nregression tasks. It is a simple and straightforward algorithm that predicts data points in a feature space based on their\\nsimilarity.\\nWhen an unknown discrete data set is received, it examines the closest k number of saved instances (nearest neighbors) and\\nreturns the most common class as the prediction. It returns the mean of the k closest neighbors for real-valued data.\\xa0\\nKNN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it makes no assumptions about the data distribution. It is suitable for a wide\\nrange of problems, particularly when the decision boundary is not overly complex. However, it can be computationally\\nexpensive for large datasets because each prediction requires calculating distances to all data points in the training set.\\nHow to Get Internship in 2023 For College Students : A Step-by-Step G\\nHow to Get Internship in 2023 For College Students : A Step-by-Step G‚Ä¶\\nHow to Evaluate a Classifier\\nPrecision and Recall\\xa0\\nPrecision is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall is the fraction of relevant instances\\nthat have been retrieved over the total number of relevant instances.\\nHoldout Method\\nOut of all the options, the holdout method is the one that is most frequently used to assess a classifier. The presented data set\\nis split into two partitions, test and train. 20% of the data is used for testing, and the remaining 80% is used for training. With\\nthe help of the training set, the model will be developed, and the secret test data will be used to gauge its propensity for\\nfuture prediction.\\nCross-Validation\\nOverfitting is a common problem in machine learning and occurs in most models. K-fold cross-validation can be conducted to\\nverify that the model is not overfitted. In this method, the data set is randomly partitioned into K-mutually exclusive subsets,\\neach approximately equal in size. One is kept for testing, while others are used for training.

It basically\\nconsists of a root node, branches, leaf nodes etc.\\xa0\\nDecision trees are used in regression tasks providing a simple and understandable model to the user. Each decision node\\nevaluates a feature, splitting the data into branches.\\xa0\\nLeaf nodes represent final outcomes or predictions. The tree is built using algorithms that select the best feature to split on at\\neach node. Techniques like pruning prevent overfitting.\\xa0\\nDecision trees are versatile handling classification and regression tasks, making them widely used for machine learning and\\ndata analysis.\\nLet Us Understand Decision Tree In Machine Learning More\\nClearly With An Example:\\nImagine you‚Äôre deciding whether to go for a walk with the help of a decision tree. The decision tree would start at the top with\\na question like,\\xa0\\n‚ÄúIs the weather sunny?‚Äù If yes, it might ask, ‚ÄúIs it windy?‚Äù If not windy, you go for a walk; if windy, you stay inside.\\xa0\\nIf the weather isn‚Äôt sunny, the decision tree might ask, ‚ÄúIs it raining?‚Äù If yes, stay inside; if no, you can still go for a walk. Each\\nquestion leads to different paths, like branches on a tree, until you reach a final decision at the end.\\nDecision Tree Terminologies:\\nRoot Node:\\nIt is the top most node in the decision tree from where the decision making process begins, it contains the initial input of a\\ndata and leads to further decision nodes.\\nDecision Nodes:\\xa0\\nNodes resulting from the splitting of root nodes are known as decision nodes, each decision node is further splitted into\\nanother decision nodes or leaf nodes.\\nLeaf Nodes:\\nLeaf nodes or terminal nodes are those nodes after which further division is not possible, when leaf node is divided further in\\nsuch a way that there is no further splitting of node possible it is then classified as leaf node.\\nSub Tree:\\xa0\\nSubtree can be classified as a small portion of a larger tree which consists of root nodes (determined after splitting of a large\\ntree) as well as nodes formed after splitting of that node.\\nPruning:\\nPruning refers to the process of removing branches or nodes that do not contribute significantly to the accuracy of the tree. It\\nhelps prevent overfitting and improves tree‚Äôs ability to admit new data.\\nBranch:\\nBranch is another name for Sub tree, a subsection of an entire tree is termed as a branch or subtree.\\nParent and Child Node:\\nA parent node is a node that is further divided into one or more nodes whereas a child node is classified as a node that is\\ndirectly connected to the parent node and is not divided further into any node.\\nExample Of Decision Tree In Machine Learning:\\nLets us understand decision tree with the help of an example given below:\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

What is the Purpose of Decision Tree ?\\n10.2. What is another name for a decision tree ?\\n10.3. What is a decision tree in machine learning?\\n10.4. How does a decision tree work?\\nSuppose, You want to go out to play. So you will make a decision tree as shown above.\\nHere, Weather is a root node.\\xa0\\nDecision tree will first ask ‚Äúwhat is the weather‚Äù there are three conditions weather can be: Sunny , Cloudy or Rainy.\\xa0\\nSunny, Cloudy and Rainy are Sub-Nodes here.\\nIf sunny, decision tree will further ask ‚Äúis the humidity high or normal‚Äù\\nIf high then the answer for playing outside will be ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and if normal the answer for playing outside will be ‚Äúyes‚Äù.\\nSimilarly, If we select cloudy the answer for playing outside will be ‚Äúyes‚Äù.\\nHow Decision Tree Algorithm Works:\\nLet us understand the basic algorithm of the decision tree in machine learning through the simple steps given below:\\nStart with the Root Node-\\xa0 Begin at the root node of the decision tree, which represents the entire dataset. Root\\nnodes basically contain the base question on which the entire tree is based.\\nAsking the Best Questions ‚Äì\\xa0 Evaluate each feature in the dataset to find the best one for splitting.\\nSplit the Dataset- Based on the answer provided to the questions of the above node, it is further divided into several\\nnodes.\\nCreating Leaf Nodes\\xa0 ‚Äì When the algorithm stops splitting, the final nodes are called leaf nodes. Each leaf node\\nrepresents a class or a predicted value.\\nMake Predictions ‚Äì To make predictions for new data, follow the decision path from the root node to a leaf node.\\nDecision Tree Assumptions:\\nDecision tree assumptions are used to make the algorithm simpler and faster. They help create easy-to-understand rules.\\nHowever, these assumptions may not always be true in real-world data, so we need to check how well the model works in\\npractice.\\nBelow are some common assumptions used while constructing a decision tree.\\nBinary Splits:\\nBinary splitting is an important concept in decision trees.\\nBinary splitting simplifies decision-making by breaking down complex choices into simpler yes/no decisions, leading to clear\\nand interpretable decision paths in the decision tree.\\nRecursive Partitioning:\\nRecursive partitioning process is a common process used in decision trees where each node is divided into child nodes and\\nthis process continues until the stopping criteria meets.\\nThis process helps in dividing large nodes into smaller sub nodes, making trees simplified and reducing complexity.\\nHomogeneity:\\nWhile splitting data at a node in a decision tree, the main aim is to create subsets that are as similar as possible.\\nHomogeneity in a decision tree ensures that the data within each node is relatively uniform, leading to clear and accurate\\ndecision-making.\\nTop-Down Greedy Approach:\\nTop-down Greedy Approach is used to construct a good and effective decision tree. In Top-Down greedy approach each split\\nis chosen to maximize information gain and minimize impurity at the current node.\\nOverfitting:\\nOverfitting happens when a decision tree model is too complex and captures data‚Äôs noise or random fluctuations, leading to\\npoor performance on new data. Overfitting can be prevented by simplifying the tree and by doing Data Augmentation.\\nEntropy:\\nEntropy basically helps us measure how mixed or disorganized our data is, which is useful for decision-making in machine\\nlearning algorithms like decision trees.\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nLet us understand Entropy more clearly with an example:\\nImagine we have a basket of fruits, and we want to organize them based on their colors. We have three red apples, two green\\napples, and one yellow banana.\\nEntropy is like a measure of how mixed up or disorganized our fruits are in terms of their colors.\\nLow Entropy: If all the fruits are the same color (e.g., all red apples), the entropy is low because it‚Äôs very organized and easy to\\npredict.\\nHigh Entropy: If the fruits are mixed in terms of colors (e.g., red, green, and yellow), the entropy is high because it‚Äôs more\\ndisorganized and are hard to predict.\\nInformation Gain:\\nInformation Gain is an important concept of Machine learning, mostly used in decision trees. Information gain is basically\\nused to measure the effectiveness of a feature in reducing uncertainty (entropy) and improving the overall decision-making\\nprocess of the Tree.\\nInformation Gain is calculated by calculating the difference between Current Entropy of the node (before splitting) and\\nweighted sum of entropy of all the sub nodes(after splitting)\\nThis Concept helps decision trees to determine which feature to split on first by quantifying how much a feature reduces\\nuncertainty in predicting outcomes using Information Gain feature leads to more effective and accurate decision-making.\\nWhen To Stop Splitting The Decision Tree:\\nKnowing when to stop splitting in a decision tree is crucial to prevent overfitting and ensure optimized and simplified\\nDecision trees.\\nThere are several ways through which will help you in stopping your Decision tree:\\nMaximum Depth: We can limit the depth of the tree by specifying a maximum depth. This prevents the tree from growing too\\ndeep and capturing noise in the data. This can be set by using Max_depth Parameter.\\nThe more will be the Depth, More complex the tree will be. So it is advised to keep the depth of the tree short.\\nApart from this, other common ways to stop splitting include: minimum sample split, Early stopping etc.\\nLearn Machine Learning with PW Skills:\\nEnroll in our Advanced AI Course to learn the principles, basics and knowledge of all the tools required for Machine Learning.\\nWhether you are a beginner or an individual looking to switch your career, this Machine Learning Course course will be a\\nright fit for you:\\xa0\\nProviding a roadmap, and knowledge of all the tools with updated syllabus curriculum , interactive classes, practice material,\\nregular doubt sessions and guidance from experienced teachers for your better understanding helps you to get your desired\\njob in the field of Machine Learning.\\nFAQs on Decision Tree\\nDecision tree is an important part of machine learning.The purpose for creating a decision tree is to make predictions\\nand decisions analyzing past predictions, also it helps us to analyze every outcome before making any decision.\\n‚Üê Previous Post\\nNext Post ‚Üí\\nWhat is the Purpose of Decision Tree ?\\nWhat is another name for a decision tree ?\\nWhat is a decision tree in machine learning?\\nHow does a decision tree work?\\nData Science with Generative AI Course\\n‚Çπ20000\\nExplore\\nMust Read\\nAmazon Summer\\nInternship 2025 for Data\\nScientists ‚Äì An Effective\\nGuide\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 23, 2025\\nThe Summer Internship Program for\\nthe Year 2025 at Amazon: Your\\nGateway to a Data Scientist Career\\nAre you a‚Ä¶\\nData Labeling: What It Is,\\nHow It Works, and Why It\\nMatters in 2025\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 17, 2025\\nIn an age where the pot is really\\nboiling for all sorts of artificial\\nintelligence and machine-learning\\nterms, ‚Äúdata labeling‚Äù‚Ä¶\\nData Lake vs Data\\nWarehouse: Which One\\nShould You Choose in\\n2025?\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 16, 2025\\nToday, efficiency is crucial in\\nmanaging and storing data in the\\ndata-driven world; therefore, people\\nneed to learn how to‚Ä¶\\nsupport@pwskills.com\\n\\uf0e0\\n+91 8448982581\\n\\uf879\\n\\uf08c\\n\\uf167\\n\\uf2c6\\nCompany\\nAbout us\\nFAQ\\nPrivacy policy\\nContact us\\nJob assistance\\nTerms and condition\\nProducts\\nPW Skills Lab\\nExperience Portal\\nHall Of fame\\nJob Portal\\nBecome an affiliate\\nBlog\\n'}, {'Logistic Regression Machine Learning.pdf': 'Home ¬ª Data Science ¬ª Logistic Regression Machine Learning\\nData Science\\nLogistic Regression Machine Learning\\nLogistic regression machine learning is an important technique for predicting future outcomes.

It is widely used in predictive\\nmodeling to estimate the chances that a given instance falls into a specific category.\\xa0\\nFor example, in binary classification, 0 represents a negative class, while 1 represents a positive class. Logistic regression is\\nmainly effective for problems where the binary outcome variable indicates one of two possible categories (0 or 1). Some\\ncommon real-life examples of situations where this binary response is expected include-\\n1. Predicting Heart Attacks: Logistic regression can help in predicting the chances of a heart attack based on factors like\\nage, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. By analyzing these variables, the model can predict whether a person is at\\nrisk (1) or not (0).\\n2. Estimating University Admission: Logistic regression can predict a student‚Äôs chances of getting admission into a\\nuniversity by looking at grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities. The model predicts if the student will be\\nadmitted (1) or not (0).\\n3. Identifying Spam Emails: Logistic regression can classify emails as spam or not by analyzing features like focus\\nkeywords, sender information, and email structure. The model predicts if an email is spam (1) or not (0).\\nKey Advantages Of Logistic Regression\\nLogistic regression machine learning has several key advantages and features that make it a standout choice from other\\nregression techniques, some of the key advantages of this include-\\xa0\\n1. Simple And Efficient: Logistic regression is straightforward and easy to understand. It‚Äôs one of the simplest machine\\nlearning algorithms, providing efficient features to handle large datasets and make predictions quickly.\\n2. Easily Interpretable: The results of logistic regression are easy to interpret. The predictions can be directly translated\\ninto meaningful insights that help in making quick decisions.\\n3. Feature Importance: Logistic regression machine learning allows you to understand the impact of each feature on the\\nprediction. This helps in identifying which factors are most influential in determining the outcome.\\n4. Flexibility: It can be used for a wide range of classification problems, from medical diagnosis to email filtering, making\\nit a flexible tool in various fields.\\n5. Handles Linearly Separable Data Well: Logistic regression machine learning works particularly well when the classes\\nare linearly separable, meaning a clear boundary can be drawn between the different classes.\\n6. Probability Estimates: It provides probabilities for each situations, which can be useful for making informed decisions.\\nFor example, knowing the probability of a customer making a purchase can help businesses in making prior marketing\\nstrategies.\\nThese advantages make logistic regression a valuable and accessible tool for anyone starting with machine learning.\\nLogistic Regression Machine Learning ‚Äì Sigmoid\\nFunction\\nLogistic regression machine learning is used to predict binary outcomes, such as yes/no or true/false. The key equation of\\nlogistic regression is the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. It transforms the linear equation output into a\\nprobability between 0 and 1.\\nAdditionally, in logistic regression, after calculating the probability using the sigmoid function, we compare it to a set\\nthreshold. If the probability is above this threshold, the model predicts that the situation belongs to a certain class. whereas,\\nif the probability falls below the threshold, the model predicts that the situation does not belong to that class. This threshold\\ndetermines the decision boundary for classifying data into different categories based on their estimated probabilities.\\nThe sigmoid function is basically an activation function for logistic regression and is defined as ‚Äì\\xa0\\nWhere,\\ne = Base of natural logarithms.\\nx = numerical value one wishes to transform\\nEquation For Logistic Regression\\nLogistic regression is a statistical method used to predict binary outcomes by fitting data to a logistic curve.

What is the sigmoid function and why is it important?\\n9.2. How do you handle multicollinearity in logistic regression?\\n9.3. What are the key assumptions of logistic regression?\\nKey Assumptions For Implementing Logistic Regression\\xa0\\nLogistic regression basically depends on several key assumptions to ensure its validity and reliability in making predictions.\\nHere are the six key assumptions that will help you to understand the concept better.\\n1. Binary Outcome\\xa0\\nThe very first assumption of logistic regression is that the variables should be binary, meaning it can take only two possible\\noutcomes. For example ‚Äì 0/1, yes/no, male/female, pass/fail, etc.\\n2. Independence of Observations\\xa0\\nThe observations used to fit the model must be independent of each other. This means that the occurrence of one\\nobservation should not affect the occurrence of another observation. This observation can generally be verified by potting\\nresiduals against time, which help in the prediction of dependencies if present.\\n3. Linearity of Independent Variables and Log Odds\\xa0\\nLogistic regression machine learning assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of\\nthe dependent variable is linear. This linearity ensures that changes in independent variables result in a proportional change\\nin the log odds.\\xa0Here, Long Odds are different from probabilities, they refer to the ratio of success to failure, while probability\\nrefers to the ratio of success to everything that can occur.\\nLet us understand what long odd is, with an example-: consider that you play 15 boxing matches with your opponent. Here,\\nthe long odds of your winning are 7 to 8, while the probability of your winning is 7 to 15 (as the total games played = 15).\\n4. No Multicollinearity among Independent Variables\\xa0\\nThis assumption of logistic regression machine learning states that there should be little or no multicollinearity among the\\nindependent variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each\\nother, which can affect the model‚Äôs performance and lead to wrongful interpretation of coefficients.\\n5. Large Sample Size\\xa0\\nLogistic regression generally performs better with a large sample size. A larger sample size provides more reliable estimates\\nof the model parameters and helps ensure the stability of the model.\\n6. No Outliers\\xa0\\nAnother critical assumption of Logistic regression machine learning is its sensitivity to outliers.\\nOutliners are data points that basically deviate from the rest of the data. Outliers can influence the estimated coefficients\\nand predictions, which often leads to biased results.\\nThese assumptions are important to consider when applying logistic regression to ensure that the model accurately captures\\nthe relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the binary outcome. Violations of these\\nassumptions can lead to unreliable predictions and interpretations.\\nTypes Of Logistic Regression With Examples\\nLogistic regression machine learning is basically classified into three types, namely- binary, multinomial, and ordinal. Each of\\nthese three types is different from one another in terms of theory and execution. Let‚Äôs understand each of these types in\\ndetail with the help of an example below.\\n1. Binary Logistic Regression:\\nBinary logistic regression generally predicts a binary outcome, where the dependent variable has only two possible outcomes\\n(e.g., yes/no, pass/fail).\\nExample:\\xa0\\nPredicting whether a patient has a heart disease: Outcome ‚Äì Yes/No\\nEvaluating the risk of cancer: Outcome = high or low.\\n2. Multinomial Logistic Regression\\nMultinomial logistic regression predicts outcomes with more than two categories, but the categories are not ordered. Each\\ncategory in this type is compared to a reference category.\\nExample:\\xa0\\nPredicting a person‚Äôs preferred mode of transportation which can be car, bus, or bike.\\nPredicting the most popular transportation type for 2040 which can be electric cars, electric trains, electric buses, and\\nelectric bikes.\\n3. Ordinal Logistic Regression\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nOrdinal logistic regression is basically used when the dependent variable is in the ordered state. It predicts outcomes with\\nordered categories. The categories have a meaningful order, but the differences between categories may not be equal.\\nExample:\\xa0\\nPredicting a customer‚Äôs satisfaction level which can be low, medium, or high\\nPredicting the shirt‚Äôs size for the customer which can be XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL\\nEach type of logistic regression serves different purposes depending on the nature of the outcome variable and the data\\navailable for analysis. Understanding these different types helps in selecting the appropriate type of logistic regression for a\\nspecific predictive modeling task.\\nLogistic Regression Best Practices\\xa0\\nLogistic regression can produce an accurate model by following some best practices. These best practices basically ensure\\nthat logistic regression models are strong, reliable, accurate, and provide valuable insights for decision-making in various\\nfields.\\xa0\\nBelow are some of the most important logistic regression machine learning techniques that will help you to understand this\\nbetter.\\n1. Identify Dependent Variables: Select outcome variables that are relevant to your research question and align with\\nthe binary or categorical nature required for logistic regression. Ensure these variables accurately reflect the\\nphenomenon you aim to predict or understand, such as customer purchase behavior or disease presence.\\n2. Discover Technical Requirements of the Model: Understand and apply technical aspects of logistic regression,\\nincluding the need for independence of observations, appropriate variable scaling or transformation, and handling of\\nmulticollinearity. Meeting these requirements ensures the model‚Äôs accuracy and reliability in predicting probabilities.\\n3. Appropriately Interpret the Results: Interpret coefficients to understand how each independent variable influences\\nthe probability of the outcome. Positive coefficients increase the probability of the outcome, while negative\\ncoefficients decrease it. Ensure interpretations align with the model‚Äôs assumptions and are meaningful within the\\ncontext of your study.\\n4. Validate Observed Results: Another important practice that users can implement is validating the observed results\\nwith a sample of the original dataset using techniques like cross-validation or out-of-sample testing.\\xa0\\nThis method makes the model results more reliable, especially when working with smaller samples.\\nLearn Data Science With PW Skills\\nJoin our PW Skills Data Science with Generative AI Course to dive into the world of data science along with the essence of\\nArtificial intelligence.

Independent variables are also called predictors, and dependent variables\\nare known as target variables or outcomes. The main objective of the regression analysis is to analyze the relationship, which\\nhelps make predictions and identify patterns or derive conclusions based on the data.\\xa0\\nIt helps to answer what changes will be observed in the dependent variable with the change in independent variables. In\\nregression, we analyze data through graphs and check the variable that best fits the data points in the plot.\\xa0\\nWhy Use Regression Analysis?\\nThere are various applications of regression analysis in data analysis. Regression analysis predicts a possible outcome based\\non the continuous variable. Regression data analysis determines the relationship between dependent and independent\\nvariables. It helps to predict or forecast based on historical data, which helps to anticipate some of the future outcomes like\\nsales, stock prices, etc.\\xa0\\nIt helps to find trends in data and predict real or continuous values. It can help make predictions more accurately, like sales\\npredictions, marketing trends, and weather conditions.\\xa0\\nIt also helps understand the relationships between different variables and analyze how changes in one variable affect the\\nother. It helps in hypothesis testing and helps researchers determine if specific factors affect the favorable outcome.\\nTypes Of Regression Analysis\\nThere are different types of Regression analysis in data science and machine learning. Regression analysis analyzes the effect\\nof the independent and dependent variables. Let us discuss major important types of regression.\\xa0\\nLinear Regression\\xa0\\nLinear regression is a statistical method used to analyze and model the relationship between dependent and independent\\nvariables.

It is used to solve different regression problems in machine learning.\\xa0\\nLinear regression represents the linear relationship between independent variables and dependent variables. It represents\\nindependent variables on the X-axis and dependent variables on the Y-axis.\\xa0\\nThere are two types of Linear Regression. One with only a single input variable, also known as simple linear regression.

The dependent\\nvariables in these types of problems are in the discrete form, like 0 and 1. They work with boolean values such as true or false,\\nyes or no, etc. It works on probability concepts. Regression uses them to calculate the relationship between the dependent\\nand independent variables. It should be kept in mind that the size of the data to be taken is large and that there is no\\ncorrelation between any of the independent variables in the data.\\nUnlike linear regression, it predicts the possibility that an observation belongs to one of the two classes. It uses a logistic\\nfunction to map any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1. These two numbers represent the probability.

Linear regression\\n2. Polynomial regression\\n3. Logistics Regression\\nLinear Regression\\nLinear regression in machine learning is a method used to understand and predict the relationship between two variables,\\nthese two variables are basically referred to as the input variable (independent variable) and the output variable (dependent\\nvariable). The goal of linear regression is to find a linear equation that best fits the data points, allowing us to make\\npredictions about the output variable based on the input variable.\\nLet us understand linear regression with a simple example to make it more clear:\\nImagine plotting points on a graph where one axis represents the input variable (like temperature) and the other axis\\nrepresents the output variable (like ice cream sales). Linear regression helps us draw a line through these points that shows\\nthe general trend or pattern in the data. This line can then be used to estimate the ice cream sales (output value) based on the\\ntemperature (input values).\\xa0\\nHence, we can say that linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning for understanding and predicting\\nlinear relationships between variables.\\nConsider this diagram and relate this with an example shared above, where temperature is an independent variable and\\nicecream is a dependent variable which is dependent on temperature.\\nIf the temperature rises, sales of ice cream will also increase and vice versa.\\nPositive Linear Relationship\\nIn this type of linear relationship if the dependent variable on the Y axis rises, the independent variable on the X axis will also\\nrise.\\nExample of this type of variable is shown in the picture above.\\nNegative Linear Relationship\\nIn this type of relationship, the dependent variable on the Y-axis decreases and the independent variable at the X-axis will\\nincrease.\\nExample of the same is given below for your reference.\\nGradient Descent\\nGradient descent is a method used in linear regression to find the best parameters for the linear equation that fits the data. It\\nis basically a optimization technique that iteratively adjusts the parameters of the linear equation to minimize the difference\\nbetween predicted and actual values, helping us find the best-fitting line for our data\\nIn simple terms, it‚Äôs like adjusting the slope and intercept of the line until it aligns closely with the actual data points.\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

Clustering\\nmachine learning looks at data points and tries to find similarities between them. It then groups these similar data points into\\nclusters, so that items in the same cluster are more alike than those in other clusters. This process doesn‚Äôt need any prior\\ninformation or labels; it just finds natural groupings in the data.\\nFor example, if you have a list of people‚Äôs ages and incomes, clustering machine learning algorithm can help in grouping them\\ninto categories, like ‚Äúyoung people with low income‚Äù or ‚Äúolder people with high income.‚Äù It‚Äôs useful in many areas, like\\ncustomer segmentation, medical research or in MNCs to find sales patterns.\\nTypes Of Clustering In Machine Learning\\nThere are various types of clustering in machine learning used to group similar data points together, each algorithm is unique\\nin its own way offering different functions and features. Some of the popularly used clustering algorithms are explained\\nbelow for your better understanding of the topic:\\n1. Centroid-Based Clustering:\\nCentroid-based clustering is a simple way to group data into a defined number of clusters. A popular algorithm in this\\ncategory is K-means. Let us understand below how it works:\\nK-means Clustering In Machine Learning: This method divides data into a pre-specified number of groups, called clusters.\\nEach cluster has a central point called a ‚Äúcentroid.‚Äù The algorithm starts by randomly placing these centroids and then\\nassigning each data point to the nearest centroid. The centroids are then recalculated based on the average of all data points\\nin the cluster, and the process is repeated until the centroids no longer change much. The main goal of repetition is to\\nminimize the distance between data points and their respective centroids.\\n2. Hierarchical Clustering:\\nHierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of the data points. There are two main approaches used in this type of\\ntechnique, both of the approaches are explained below for your reference:\\nAgglomerative Clustering: This method starts with each data point as its own cluster. Then, it repeatedly merges the\\nclosest clusters together until all points are in one big cluster. This creates a tree structure where the bottom leaves\\nare individual data points, and the root is the single final cluster.\\nDivisive Clustering: This is the opposite of agglomerative clustering. It starts with all data points in one cluster and\\nsplits them into smaller clusters, these smaller clusters continue to split until each point is its own cluster.\\nBoth of these methods can be visualized using a dendrogram. Which is basically a diagram that shows the arrangement of the\\nclusters formed.\\n3. Density-Based Clustering:\\nDensity-based clustering groups data points based on their density in the data space. Some of the majorly used techniques in\\nDB clustering machine learning are explained below for your better understanding\\nDBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This method finds clusters of different\\nshapes by looking for areas where data points are densely packed together. It can handle well the points that don‚Äôt\\nbelong to any cluster. It is especially useful when clusters are of varying shapes and sizes.\\nOPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure): It is quite similar to DBSCAN but it is much better\\nthan it at identifying clusters in data with varying densities.\\n4. Distribution-Based Clustering:\\nDistribution-based clustering is a method that basically groups data points based on the pre-assumption that they belong to a\\nspecific distribution. It assumes that the data comes from a mixture of different distributions, and each cluster is represented\\nby one of these distributions.\\nThis method is flexible because it can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes, unlike some other clustering methods that\\nassume all clusters are similar in shape.\\nThese clustering methods offer different ways to group data based on their similarities, making them valuable tools for\\nanalyzing complex datasets in a simple and efficient manner.\\nClustering In Machine Learning Applications\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

This training dataset includes\\nboth correct and incorrect results, allowing the model to improve over time. The loss function is used to determine the\\nalgorithm‚Äôs accuracy, and iterations are performed until the error is sufficiently reduced.\\xa0\\nDifference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Lear\\nDifference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Lear‚Ä¶\\nThere are two types of supervised learning problems in data mining:\\nAn algorithm is used in classification to classify test data into different categories precisely. Specific entities in the\\ndataset are identified, and an attempt is made to determine how these entities should be defined or labeled. Examples\\nof popular classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, K-nearest\\nneighbors, and random forests.\\nRegression is a statistical method for determining the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

The\\nmost popular learning techniques, which are typically calculated using software like R or Python, are briefly described below:\\nNeural Network\\nThe Neural Network is specially designed for deep learning algorithms, Neural networks process training data by simulating\\nthe interconnectivity of the human brain via layers of nodes.\\xa0\\nEvery node has inputs, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. If the output value exceeds a certain threshold, the node\\n‚Äúfires‚Äù or activates, and data is sent to the next network layer. Neural networks learn this mapping function via supervised\\nlearning, with gradient descent adjustments made in response to the loss function. We can be confident in the model‚Äôs\\naccuracy to produce the right answer when the cost function is at or close to zero.\\nNaive Bayes\\nNaive Bayes is a classification approach based on the Bayes theorem‚Äôs principle of class conditional independence.

This\\nmethod is most commonly used in text classification, spam detection, and recommendation systems.\\nLinear Regression\\nSimple linear regression is used when only one independent variable and one dependent variable are present. Simple linear\\nregression is used when there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable.\\nWhen the quantity of independent variables rises, multiple linear regression is employed. Each type of linear regression\\nattempts to plot a line of best fit determined by the least squares method. Compared to other regression models, this line is\\nstraight when plotted on a graph.\\nLogistic regression\\nLogistic regression is used when the dependent variable is classified with binary outputs such as ‚Äútrue‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù or ‚Äúyes‚Äù\\nand ‚Äúno.‚Äù While both regression models seek to understand relationships between data inputs, logistic regression is primarily\\nused to solve binary classification problems like spam detection.\\nK-nearest neighbor\\nThe KNN algorithm, also known as the K-nearest neighbor, is a non-parametric algorithm for classifying data points based on\\ntheir proximity and association with other available data. This algorithm assumes that data points with similar characteristics\\ncan be found nearby.\\xa0\\nAs a result, it attempts to calculate the distance between data points, typically using Euclidean distance, and then assigns a\\ncategory based on the most frequently occurring category or average. It is popular among data scientists due to its ease of\\nuse and short calculation time, but as the test dataset grows, so does the processing time, making it less appealing for\\nclassification tasks.\\xa0 KNN is commonly employed in recommendation engines and image recognition.\\xa0\\nSupport vector machines (SVM)\\nA support vector machine (SVM) is a popular supervised learning model developed by Vladimir Vapnik that can be used for\\ndata classification as well as regression. It is, however, most commonly used for classification problems, where it constructs a\\nhyperplane with the greatest distance between two classes of data points. The decision boundary is the hyperplane that\\nseparates the data point classes (for example, oranges vs. apples) on either side of the plane.\\nSupervised Learning Examples\\nA variety of business applications, including the following, can be built and advanced using supervised learning models:\\nImage and object recognition: Supervised learning algorithms can be used to locate, isolate, and categorize objects in\\nvideos or images, making them useful when applied to various computer vision techniques and imagery analysis.\\nPredictive analytics: Using supervised learning models to build predictive analytics systems that provide deep\\ninsights into various business data points is a common use case. This enables businesses to forecast specific outcomes\\nbased on a given output variable, assisting business leaders in justifying decisions or pivoting for the organization‚Äôs\\nbenefit.\\nCustomer sentiment analysis: Organizations can extract and classify important pieces of information from large\\nvolumes of data, such as context, emotion, and intent, with minimal human intervention by using supervised machine\\nlearning algorithms. This can be extremely helpful in gaining a better understanding of customer interactions and in\\nimproving brand engagement efforts.\\nSpam detection: Another example of a supervised learning model is spam detection. Organizations can effectively\\norganize spam and non-spam correspondences by training databases to recognize patterns or anomalies in new data\\nusing supervised classification algorithms.\\nChallenges of Supervised Learning\\nAlthough supervised learning can offer businesses advantages such as deep data insights and improved automation, there\\nare some challenges when building sustainable supervised learning models. The following are some of these challenges:\\nSupervised learning models can require certain levels of expertise to structure accurately.\\nTraining supervised learning models can be very time-intensive.\\nDatasets can have a higher likelihood of human error, resulting in algorithms learning incorrectly.\\nUnlike unsupervised learning models, supervised learning cannot cluster or classify data on its own.\\nSupervised Learning FAQs\\nQ1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of supervised machine learning?\\nAns. Supervised learning excels at classification and regression problems, such as determining the category of a news article\\nor forecasting sales volume for a given future date.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial\\nintelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being specially programmed\\nto do so.\\xa0\\nInstead of following a set of fixed instructions, machine learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships within the\\ndata to improve their performance over time. For example, machine learning is used in recommendations on streaming\\nservices, email spam filtering, and even in the concept of self-driving cars. It basically helps systems to adapt and get better\\nwith their usage, making it a powerful tool for solving complex problems and enhancing everyday technologies.\\nTypes Of Machine Learning\\nThere are various types of machine learning techniques available, each with special features and uses. Some of the common\\ntypes of machine learning algorithms used in our day-to-day life are as follows:\\nSupervised Machine Learning\\nUnsupervised Machine Learning\\nSemi-Supervised Machine Learning\\nReinforcement Learning\\nWe have explained below, each one of these types of machine learning in detail along with their applications and\\ncharacteristics, let us move further and understand it in a better way.\\n1. Supervised Learning\\nSupervised learning is one of the important types of machine learning algorithms, where the algorithm is trained using\\nlabeled data. This means that the data provided to the algorithm includes input-output pairs, where the correct output is\\nalready known. The algorithm learns from this data by finding patterns and relationships between the inputs and the outputs.\\nOnce the model is trained, It can predict the output for new, unseen data based on what it has learned. A simple example of\\nthis algorithm is written below that will help you to clear your concept.\\nExample of Supervised Learning\\nConsider a scenario where you need to build a model to classify different types of fruits. You start by feeding the algorithm a\\ndataset of images of fruits, where each image is labeled with the type of fruit it represents, such as apples, bananas, and\\noranges. The algorithm learns to recognize the features that differentiate one fruit from another, like shape, color, and size.\\nWhen you later input a new image of a fruit that the algorithm has never seen before, it will use the learned patterns to\\npredict whether the fruit is an apple, banana, or orange. This process tells how supervised learning works.\\nTypes Of Supervised Learning\\xa0\\nThe supervised learning algorithm is further classified into two main types that include: Classification Learning and\\nRegression Learning. Let us understand each of these types in detail and see what are they used for.\\nClassification Learning\\nClassification learning is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to categorize data into specific classes or groups. The\\nalgorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with a predefined category.

How is reinforcement learning different from supervised and unsupervised learning?\\n10.3. Why is semi-supervised learning known as a hybrid approach?\\nLogistic Regression\\nSupport Vector Machine\\nRandom Forest\\nDecision Tree\\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\\nNaive Bayes\\nRegression Learning\\nRegression learning is another type of supervised learning where the aim is to predict a continuous value rather than a\\ncategory. The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset with input-output pairs, where the output is a numerical value. For\\nexample, in predicting house prices, the algorithm learns from features such as square foot area, number of bedrooms, and\\nlocation. The model uses this information to predict the price of a new house based on its features. Regression is useful in\\nmany fields, including finding stock price predictions, forecasting economic trends, and many other scenarios.\\nSome Common Algorithms Used In Regression Learning Techniques Include\\nLinear Regression\\nPolynomial Regression\\nRidge Regression\\nLasso Regression\\nDecision tree\\nRandom Forest\\nAdvantages of Supervised Machine Learning\\nBeing trained on labeled data, these models generally have high accuracy.\\nThe decision-making process in supervised learning is meaningful\\nThis model generally takes less time than any other learning algorithm, as it generally uses labeled data and pre-\\ntrained models.\\nDisadvantages of Supervised Machine Learning\\nIt can not work on unlabeled data which can be a problem sometime.\\nIt can be costly as it requires special efforts to label the data first.\\n2. Unsupervised Learning\\xa0\\nUnsupervised learning is also one of the most used types of machine learning technique where the algorithm is given data\\nwithout any labels or predefined categories. The main goal of this algorithm is to find patterns or relationships within the\\ndata. Instead of being told what to look for, the algorithm identifies common characteristics on its own, grouping similar data\\npoints together. This is useful for discovering hidden patterns, grouping similar items, or reducing the amount of the data for\\nfurther analysis. An example of this algorithm is written below for your better clarity and understanding.\\nExample Of Unsupervised Learning\\xa0\\nImagine you have a dataset containing various books and their features like genre, author, number of pages, and publication\\nyear. Through clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm can group similar books together based on these features. This\\nwill reveal a group of books that belong to specific genres or those written by the same author. Bookstores can use this\\ninformation to organize their inventory more effectively or to recommend similar books to customers.\\nTypes Of Unsupervised Learning\\xa0\\nUnsupervised learning is further classified into two main types that include: Clustering and Association. Let us understand\\neach of these types in detail and see what are they used for.\\nClustering in Unsupervised Learning\\nClustering is a technique in unsupervised learning where the algorithm groups data points based on their similarities. Each\\ngroup, or cluster, contains data points that are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. This method is used\\nin various fields like- in customer segmentation, clustering can group customers with similar purchasing behaviors, allowing\\nbusinesses to personalize different marketing strategies for different customers.\\nSome of the commonly used clustering algorithms include:\\nK-Means Clustering algorithm\\nMean-shift algorithm\\nDBSCAN Algorithm\\nPrincipal Component Analysis\\nIndependent Component Analysis\\nAssociation in Unsupervised Learning\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nAssociation in unsupervised learning is a method used to discover interesting relationships or patterns between variables in\\nlarge datasets. This technique identifies rules that highlight how the occurrence of one item is associated with the occurrence\\nof another item. For example, in market basket analysis, an association algorithm can reveal that customers who buy bread\\nare likely to buy butter also. Businesses use these association rules to optimize product placements and improve inventory\\nmanagement.\\nSome of the commonly used Association rule learning algorithms include:\\nApriori Algorithm\\nEclat\\nFP-growth Algorithm\\nAdvantages of Unsupervised Machine Learning\\nUnsupervised learning helps to discover hidden patterns and relationships between the data.\\nUseful for tasks such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data exploration.\\nReduces the efforts of data labeling as labeled data is not used here.\\nDisadvantages of Unsupervised Machine Learning\\nIt is difficult to predict the quality of the model as labeled data is not used here.\\nClustering of the data may not be perfect as it is done without label.\\n3. Semi-Supervised Learning\\nSemi-supervised learning is another one of the most used types of machine learning technique that uses a small amount of\\nlabeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data. The labeled data helps the model learn to make predictions, while the\\nunlabeled data helps in improving the model‚Äôs accuracy by providing additional information about the structure of the data. A\\ncommon example of Semi-supervised learning is written below for you better understanding of the concept.\\nExample Of Semi-Supervised Learning\\nImagine you want to build a model to classify emails as spam or not spam. You have 100 labeled emails with labels of ‚Äúspam‚Äù\\nor ‚Äúnot spam‚Äù and 1000 unlabeled emails. In semi-supervised learning, you start by training the model on the 100 labeled\\nemails. Once the model is built, you use it to predict labels for the 1000 unlabeled emails. These predictions are not always\\ncorrect, but they provide additional information. This process helps the model to better understand the features and patterns\\nin the emails, resulting in improved performance.\\nTypes Of Semi-Supervised Learning\\nThere are various semi-supervised learning models each used for different purposes and having different characteristics\\nfrom one another. Let us understand each of its types briefly.\\n1. Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning: These models use graphs to represent the relationships between data\\npoints. Labels are spread from labeled to unlabeled points through these connections.\\n2. Label Propagation: This model is used to spread the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data through a network,\\nassuming that similar data points are close to each other.\\n3. Co-training: This approach trains two or more different models to label the unlabeled data. Each model trains on\\ndifferent parts of the data, and their predictions are used to improve each other.\\n4. Self-training: The model first trains the labeled data, and then predicts values for the unlabeled data. These new\\npredictions are added to the training set, and the model is retrained.\\nAdvantages Of Semi-Supervised Machine Learning\\nIt is better than supervised and unsupervised learning, as it works on both labeled as well as unlabeled data.\\nIt is suitable for large data sets.\\nDisadvantages Of Semi-Supervised Machine Learning\\nThese methods are more complex as compared to other approaches.\\nAvailability of labeled data is must in this algorithm, which makes it unsuitable when labeled data is not available.\\nThe model performance can be affected due to unlabeled data being present.\\n4. Reinforcement Learning\\xa0\\nReinforcement learning is a types of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an\\nenvironment to maximize a reward. The agent starts without knowledge of the best actions and learns through the trial and\\nerror method. Every action has a consequence, resulting in a reward or punishment. Over the period of time, the agent aims\\nto choose actions that give the highest cumulative reward. A common example of reinforcement learning is written below for\\nyour better clarity of the concept.\\nExample Of Reinforcement Learning\\nImagine training a dog to fetch a ball. The environment is your yard, the agent is the dog, and the action is fetching the ball.\\nWhen the dog brings the ball back, you reward it with a treat. If the dog doesn‚Äôt fetch the ball or does something else, it\\ndoesn‚Äôt receive a treat which is a negative reward.\\xa0\\nIn the starting stage, the dog may not understand what to do, but over a period of time, it learns that fetching the ball leads to\\na treat. The dog‚Äôs goal is to get more rewards by fetching more balls. Through repeated experiences and rewards, the dog\\nimproves its fetching behavior.\\nTypes Of Reinforcement Learning\\xa0\\nThere are primarily three types of reinforcement learning techniques, each having different characteristics and each used for\\ndifferent purposes. Let us understand the working of each technique with the explanation given below-\\nQ-learning\\nQ-learning is a simple and popular reinforcement learning technique. It uses a Q-table to store values representing the\\nexpected future rewards of taking a specific action in a specific state. The agent updates the Q-values based on the rewards\\nreceived, and over time, it learns the optimal actions to take in each state to maximize its overall reward.\\nSARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)\\nSARSA is another reinforcement learning technique similar to Q-learning, but it updates the Q-values based on the action the\\nagent actually takes rather than the best possible action. This makes SARSA more conservative and ensures the agent learns\\nbased on the current policy.\\nApplications Of Machine Learning Algorithms\\nIn this modern era, where everything is relying on technology, machine learning has various important applications in our\\nday-to-day lives. Here are some key applications of machine learning, that will help you to understand its importance:\\nMachine learning algorithms can identify objects, people, and activities in images and videos, as well as can also\\ninterpret spoken language.\\nIt is also used for sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbots, helping machines understand and respond to\\nhuman language.\\nMachine learning algorithms also assist doctors in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and personalizing\\ntreatment plans based on patient data.\\nThese Algorithms enhance fraud detection, predict trading prices, and improve credit scoring and risk management.\\nThese different types of Machine learning algorithms are used by companies like Amazon and Netflix to suggest\\nproducts or content based on user preferences.\\nDifferent types of machine learning algorithms are used in self-driving cars to analyze their environment, make\\ndecisions, and navigate safely.\\nML algorithms are used in virtual assistants and chatbots to provide instant support and improve customer\\ninteraction.\\nDifferent types of Machine Learning techniques are used to create intelligent non-player characters to improve game\\nexperience.\\nML techniques also help in predicting equipment failures in industries, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.\\nLearn Machine Learning With PW Skills\\nStart your journey into the world of AI with our detailed PW Skills Generative AI And Data Science Course specially\\ndesigned to serve candidates with different skill sets.

It uses\\ndiagrams, symbols, and text to represent data and shows how they relate to each other. This process is the first important\\nstep in defining how data is structured and used in a system.\\xa0\\nData Modeling involves creating data models that describe how data is connected with each other. These models are then\\neventually used to build databases or update old software systems. By using data modeling, companies ensure consistency in\\nhow data is named, organized, and secured, which ultimately helps in improving their data analysis\\xa0process. The main focus is\\non making data available and well-organized to the team, regardless of how it is applied.\\nTypes Of Data Models\\nDesigning a database or information system starts with a simple idea and gradually becomes more detailed. Data models,\\nwhich represent the structure of the data, can be grouped into three types based on how detailed they are: conceptual,\\nlogical, and physical.\\xa0\\nThe process usually begins with a conceptual model, then moves to a logical model, and finally ends with a physical model. Let\\nus understand each of these models in detail with the help of the diagram given below:\\nTypes Of Data Models\\n1. Conceptual Data Models\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese models are also known as domain models and they basically give an overview of what the system will include, how it\\nwill be organized, and the main business rules involved. Conceptual models are created early in the project to help in\\ngathering requirements. They identify important things that need to be represented in the system, their attributes, and how\\nthey relate to each other. These models also consider security and data integrity, but they are usually simple and\\nstraightforward.\\n2. Logical Data Models\\nLogical models are more detailed than conceptual models. They describe the data and relationships in the system more\\nprecisely, often using formal notation systems. Logical models also define data attributes, such as data types and sizes, but\\nthey don‚Äôt get into technical system details.\\xa0\\nThese models are sometimes skipped in agile or DevOps practices but are useful in projects that are data-focused, like\\ndesigning data warehouses or reporting systems.\\n3. Physical Data Models\\xa0\\xa0\\nPhysical models are the most detailed data models, they basically show how data will be stored in a database. These models\\nprovide a final design that can be implemented as a relational database. They include tables that represent relationships\\nbetween entities, along with primary and foreign keys to maintain these relationships. Physical models also consider specific\\ndatabase management system (DBMS) features, such as performance tuning, managing, easy storing, and data retrieval.\\nData Modeling Process\\nData modeling is a method used to understand how data is processed and stored. It involves careful planning of how data will\\nbe represented and how it will meet business needs. Different data modeling techniques use specific symbols and layouts to\\nshow how data is structured. Let us understand the basic steps involved in the data modeling process with the help of the\\nsteps written below:\\nSearch\\nRecent Posts\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

Why is data modeling important?\\n8.2. What are the types of data models?\\n8.3. What tools are used for data modeling?\\n1. Identify Entities: The very first step of data modeling process is to start by identifying the key things, events, or\\nconcepts in the data set. These are called entities, and each one should be different from the others.\\n2. Identify Key Properties: As we have talked above that each entity in the data set must have unique characteristics\\nknown as attributes. Your main work in this step is to find those unique attributes for an entity. For example, a\\n‚Äúcustomer‚Äù entity may have attributes like first name, last name, and phone number, while an ‚Äúaddress‚Äù entity may\\ninclude a street name, city, and zip code.\\n3. Identify Relationships: In the next step, determine how these entities relate to each other. For example, a customer\\nmay have a permanent address and an order may be shipped to a different address labeled as ‚Äúoffice address‚Äù. These\\nrelationships are often shown using diagrams like Unified Modeling Language (UML).\\n4. Map Attributes: In this step, Your job is to make sure that all attributes are properly connected to their entities. This\\nstep ensures that the data model accurately represents how the business will use the data. Various patterns can be\\nused for this purpose depending on the needs of the business.\\n5. Assign Keys and Normalize Data: In this step, you will assign unique identifiers, or keys, to link related data without\\nduplicating information. This step, known as normalization will help in reducing the storage space but may affect how\\nquickly the data can be accessed.\\n6. Finalize and Validate: Finally, In the last step, review and refine the data model to make sure it meets business needs.\\nThis process should be repeated as there might be data that needs to be changed over time.\\nThis approach helps in creating a clear and organized structure for data, making it easier to manage and use.\\nTypes Of Data Modeling\\nIn today‚Äôs time, Data modeling has evolved a lot with database systems. With the passage of time, it has become more\\ncomplex as data storage needs have grown. Here are some of the common types of data models that are widely used by\\ncompanies to fulfill their needs and demands:\\n1. Hierarchical data models organize data in a tree-like structure, showing one-to-many relationships. Each record has a\\nsingle root or parent that connects to one or more child tables. This model was first used in the IBM Information\\nManagement System (IMS) in 1966, especially in banking.\\xa0\\nWhile it is less efficient as compared to newer models, it is still used in systems like Extensible Markup Language (XML) and\\ngeographic information systems (GIS).\\n2. Relational data models were introduced by IBM researcher E.F. Codd in 1970 and are still widely used today. They\\norganize data in tables where data segments are joined, making database management simpler.\\xa0Relational databases often\\nuse structured query language (SQL) to manage data. These databases are effective at maintaining data accuracy and\\nreducing redundancy, making them ideal for transaction processing system.\\n3. Entity-relationship (ER) data models basically use diagrams to show the relationships between entities in a database. Data\\narchitects use ER modeling tools to create visual maps that help in designing databases.\\n4. Object-oriented data models became popular in the mid-1990s with the rise of object-oriented programming. In these\\nmodels, ‚Äúobjects‚Äù represent real-world entities which are grouped into class hierarchies with associated features. Object-\\noriented databases can handle complex data relationships and are used in multimedia, hypertext databases, and other\\nadvanced applications.\\n5. Dimensional data models were developed by Ralph Kimball to speed up data retrieval in data warehouses. Unlike\\nrelational and ER models, which focus on efficient storage, dimensional models prioritize quick access to information, even if\\nit promotes redundancy. These models are commonly used in online analytical processing (OLAP) systems.\\nAdvantages Of Data Modeling\\xa0\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nData modeling is a key part of building software or database systems. It offers several benefits and features which include:\\n1. Better Understanding of Data: Data modeling shows how data is organized and connected, which helps people in\\nmaking better decisions about how to use and store it.\\n2. Better Data Quality: By finding mistakes and inconsistencies in data, data modeling improves the overall quality of the\\ndata and prevents issues.\\n3. Better Collaboration: It helps everyone involved in the development process to communicate more effectively,\\nleading to better decisions and outcomes.\\n4.

An Introductory Dive into the\\nConcept\\nTo kick the discussion on data lake vs. data warehouse, we need to ask: What is a Data Lake? A data lake is like an enormous\\nbody of raw data that can hold everything ‚Äì structured, unstructured, or semi-structured. Whether it be a CSV file, an app log,\\nor a video clip, it‚Äôs all in a data lake. There is no requirement for upfront organization. Store it first; for structure, do it later\\nwhen you need to analyze the data. It‚Äôs definitely flexible and thus becomes the sophistication of data scientists and\\nengineers.\\nData Lake Advantages: Reasons You Need Them\\nThe discussion about Data Lake vs Data Warehouse would not be complete without the mentioning of the fact that,\\nincreasingly, everyone seems to be talking more about data lakes.\\xa0\\nBelow are important Data Lake Benefits:\\nFlexibility\\nThere is no restriction on the types of data that can be stored; no pre-formatting before storing is needed.\\nCost-effective\\nStorage costs are generally low with such types of systems, especially in a cloud environment.\\nReal-Time Data Ingestion\\nExcellent for most applications for big data analysis.\\nSupports Advanced Analytics\\nConsidered as one of the best solutions for machine learning, AI, and predictive modeling applications.\\nBig data would be a world that sees data lakes as an open modern solution that can scale.\\nData Warehouse Definition: The Candor Powerhouse of\\nData Storage\\nMoving on with our data lake vs. data warehouse comparison, now let‚Äôs discuss the data warehouse definition. Data\\nwarehouses are basically systems for storage in this structure, where the data has already been transformed and organized\\nwhen it gets into the store. This means that when data gets to the warehouse, it will have followed a schema; that is, it will\\nhave been formatted before it was stored. Most often, businesses will use data warehouses in business reporting,\\ndashboards, and routine analytics. It is best to use them when reliable and consistent data is needed for decision-making.\\nData Warehouse Benefit: Why Companies are Still Using\\nThem\\nAlthough data lake usage is the trend now, it is also true that a lot of organizations still invest heavily in building and\\nmaintaining data warehouses. Why? Because of these Data Warehouse Benefits:\\nVery well organized: Clean, structured, and formatted data is queried easily.\\nPerformance: Optimized for very complex queries and reporting.\\nSecurity and governance: Applying strict controls over data is more accessible.\\nReliable for business intelligence: It‚Äôs mainly for routine reporting and KPIs.\\xa0\\nIn the data lake vs. data warehouse argument, this classic system is still the trusted choice for businesses requiring accuracy\\nand compliance.\\nKey Differences: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse\\nThere is more to the real difference between data lake vs. data warehouse:\\xa0\\nA data lake accepts all types of input (structured/unstructured), while a warehouse needs to have a clean input\\nstructure.\\nCosts of storage: Storing large amounts in a data lake will usually be much cheaper, while warehouses can be even\\nmore expensive on account of their processing needs.\\nUsers: More attractive to the data scientists, while analysts and business users will probably use the warehouse.\\nUse Case: Use data lakes for predictive analysis, while data warehouses serve more for historical reporting.\\xa0\\nData Processing: Process after storage in a lake. In a warehouse, data is processed before storage.\\nThis is a clear comparison of data lake vs. data warehouse, and understanding the two would enable us to find out which\\nwould be fitting for various needs.\\nUse Cases: When Data Lake vs Data Warehouse Should\\nBe Used\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

The answer is simple: that would\\ndepend on your goals.\\nChoose Data Lake when dealing with large amounts of various formed data types like social media, video, or sensor\\ninformation.\\nData Warehouse should be adopted for structured reports and dashboard insights with standardized forms of data.\\nIn most modern companies, both are applied simultaneously.\\nUnderstanding data lake vs. data warehouse is not just about choosing sides but rather knowing how to use both wisely.\\nReal-Life Examples: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse in\\nAction\\nIs the real-world dynamic unclear? Here is how the big boys have got it going:\\nData lakes store user logs, viewing behaviors, and clickstreams by Netflix for deeper insights and AI modelling.\\nAmazon uses Data Warehouse for inventory tracking, sales report generation, as well as business KPIs monitoring.\\nThese real-life scenarios show that these two components work in tandem in the synergistic support of different functions.\\nIntegration and Modern Stack: Merging Data Lake and\\nData Warehouse\\xa0\\nThe modern world has started with the blurring between Data Lake vs Data Warehouse. The architectures of lakehouse, for\\ninstance, offer the best of both worlds-the flexibility of data lakes with the structure of data warehouses. Databricks and\\nSnowflake, among others, make it possible to store any type of data while enabling real-time analysis.\\xa0\\nSuch separation indicates that the understanding Data Lake vs Data Warehouse will help professionals in a solid design for\\nthe data infrastructure.\\xa0\\nLearning Curve: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse\\xa0\\nHowever, when you are starting your journey with data, the distinction between Data Lake vs Data Warehouse can make a\\ntremendous difference regarding making your career obstacle-free. Students can learn using cloud platforms like AWS,\\nAzure, or Google Cloud to build data lakes. Professionals can dedicate time and effort to learning tools such as SQL, ETL, or BI\\ndashboards and have a deeper knowledge of warehouses. These concepts are also very much at the center of courses in data\\nscience and analytics.\\xa0\\nUnderstanding What is a Data Lake, Data Lake Benefits, and Data Warehouse Definition can be your stepping stone towards\\na future-proof career.\\nKeep Learning with PW Skills\\nWant to master real-world data skills?

Consider an actual pipeline bringing water from a\\nreservoir to your home. The water in the pipeline is just like the data- something is always moving from the start to its\\ndestination. The pipeline refers to a sequence of steps put into place to manipulate data, starting from the collection stage\\nand enduringly finishing with either storage or analytic applications afore detailed in the process of finding information. ETL-\\nExtract, Transform, Load-finds its way as applicable names for them. The aim of data processes like this is to make data flow\\nwithout any lags and to make it available instantly or on a delayed schedule for actions associated with business intelligence,\\nreporting, or machine learning.\\xa0\\nImportance of Data Pipelines in Modern Workflows\\nData pipelines are a crucial thing in business life. Business organizations generate a lot of data right from customer\\ninteractions and social media posts to IoT sensors and financial transactions, every second. Managing data and analysis in a\\nmanual manner is close to impossible. That‚Äôs precisely when data pipelines became a must-have. For your company, data\\npipelines are keys for laying down the whole infrastructure to become data-driven. Once operational, they take out\\nduplications, decrease human error, and assure that the right data is delivered to the correct recipient at the right point in\\ntime.\\nHow to Build a Data Pipeline\\nThey now have concordance on what data pipelines are and how vital a function they provide; hence, it is imperative to now\\nmove to construct a data pipeline. The process takes hold; it needs a lot of substantial groundwork: foul and drainage,\\nbricklayers, roofing, and so forth. Once the first few contracts have taken place with the pipe sealer and the rest, the workers\\nput a bend in the pipe, letting extra curing of the joint. Santiago, in the meantime, still thinks about Manolin. He does not have\\nto think about the fish.\\nParts Of Data Pipelines\\nThere are several types of data pipelines; knowledge of these becomes really important while choosing one for your specific\\nuse case. One of the most common types is the batch data pipeline that processes data in chunks at scheduled intervals,\\nmaking it perfect for long-running processes with logs or daily sales reports. The other kind is the real-time or streaming data\\npipeline, which is made for scenarios where data processing cannot wait for any time. Useful for online shopping fraud\\ndetection and live dashboards. Hybrid combinations of real-time and batch are designed to give more flexibility. Cloud-native\\npipelines have been given more recognition these days, enabling scalability with less maintenance. Choice of type of data\\npipeline should be guided by factors like data volume, processing requirements, and business objectives.\\xa0\\n\\xa0Join Our Data Science Telegram Channel\\n Join Our Data Science WhatsApp Channel\\nArticles in the Data Application Kit\\nIn particular, the components that need to be incorporated into data pipelines. The first component and probably the most\\nimportant is the source bringing the raw data towards the pipeline systems. These sources could be internal databases, third-\\nparty APIs, or IoT middleware. The ingestion layer transports the data inside the system by pulling it, taking advantage of\\ntools such as Apache NiFi or Kafka. This is followed by the processing layer that ensures data transformation takes place\\nusing Apache Spark as a framework or just a set of SQL scripts. The storage layer stores the refined data and uses data lakes\\nalong with data warehouses. Finally, the orchestration layer coordinates all components effectively by implementing\\norchestration of components using software such as Apache Airflow or AWS Step Functions. Each of these components has a\\nnecessary role to play in making sure that data operates smoothly.\\nProblems in Building and Maintaining Data Pipelines\\nThe advantages of data pipelines are many; the problems with them are few. The biggest issue here is data quality. If\\ninconsistent or corrupt, the source data will have its errors reflected downstream through the pipeline. Latencies can be a\\nchallenge, especially for real-time pipelines, where time counts in milliseconds. Then there are scalability and cost\\nconsiderations as the data volumes grow. Maintenance is a continuous exercise of monitoring, error checking, and modifying\\nthe pipeline to accommodate new data sources or formats. All these concerns notwithstanding, the benefits of a well-\\ndesigned data pipeline outweigh the drawbacks, especially from the perspective of business alignment.\\xa0\\nSafety and Compliance of Data Pipelines\\nData safety and compliance became central in designing data pipelines when hacking sites and regulatory regime became the\\norder of the day. Organizations must make sure that data is encrypted in transit and on the location of sensitive information\\nlike personal details and items coming close to financial records. Such access control mechanisms must zero in on authorized\\nindividuals who can have access to and manipulate data. On top of this set of frameworks of compliance, such as GDPR and\\nHIPAA, must also be part of the old design standards of a pipeline. If it does not pass this plan, it could get stuck on the legal\\nside and damage its name in the long run. Building a solid data pipeline should consist of legislative trial records, anomaly\\ndetection systems as well as ongoing compliance checks that submit the essence of trustworthiness and legal integrity.\\xa0\\nReal-Life Use Cases of Data Pipelines\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

These very real implementations show how wide-\\nranging, and even more importantly, how very transformational data pipelines can be across sectors, thus giving credence to\\ntheir worth of transforming raw data into actionable business insights.\\xa0\\nFuture Trends in Data Pipelines\\nThe data pipelines arena is quickly evolving with advancements in AI, cloud computing, and big data. One main trend is to\\nmove toward serverless data pipelines with complete infrastructure management by cloud providers, leaving teams to\\nconcentrate solely on data logic. Machine learning is further being embedded in pipelines for automated data quality checks\\nand anomaly detection. DataOps-a new approach that combines DevOps principles with data engineering-is gaining traction\\nas a means to establish better pipeline reliability and team collaboration. Another exciting trend is low-code or no-code\\npipeline tools, allowing users who are not engineers to build and manage data pipelines efficiently. For anyone engaged in\\ndata engineering or analytics, keeping track of these trends is an absolute must.\\nAlso Read:\\n1. Data Farming Explained: 5 Modern Methods, Future Opportunities\\n2.

The main difference is that Data Mining extracts insights from existing data, whereas Data\\nFarming is concerned with the creation of synthetic or simulated data to model real-world scenarios.\\xa0\\nThe figure of Data Farming was born through military and scientific research but has jetted off into several other sectors,\\nincluding finance, health care, and AI development. Synthetic data allows organizations to test hypotheses, predict trends,\\nand optimize systems without being constrained to purely historical data. This makes Data Farming attractive when the\\nretrieval of real-world data becomes scarce or prohibitively expensive.\\nWhen using Data Farming versus Data Mining, the prime distinction lies in the approach: Data Mining digs deep into existing\\ndatasets looking for patterns, while Data Farming grows new datasets to cater to a given need. Both have feet in analytics,\\nbut Data Farming bears unique advantages when it comes to predictive modeling and scenario testing.\\nData Farming Key Techniques in Today‚Äôs World\\nData Farming goes beyond just data collecting; it intelligently synthesizes, refines, and uses synthetic data sets to solve real-\\nworld problems. Unlike conventional data analysis, which has to work with historical data, Data Farming creates data from\\nsimulations, AI models, and computational techniques. Here are some of the most impactful processes in Data Farming in\\neffect today along with actual examples:\\n1. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM): The Simulation of Complex Systems\\nOne of the most powerful Data Farming techniques is Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), which encapsulates autonomous\\n‚Äúagents‚Äù (digital entities) interacting with one another in a simulated environment according to rules that have been\\npredefined for them; a form of collective behavior emerges from the combination of the actions of the agents in this system,\\nwhich generates huge amounts of data.\\nHow It Works:\\nAgents can stand for customers, vehicles, animals, or entire organizations.\\nThey interact with each other and their environment to create dynamic datasets.\\nResearchers tweak variable settings to observe different results.\\nPresent-Day Applications:\\nUrban Planning: Simulating the traffic flows to plan the best city built environment.\\nEconomics: The stock market behavior under various policies.\\nEpidemiology: Forecasting the diffusion of diseases and optimal response by public health.\\nThis is of extreme use in Data Farming because it allows the simulation of scenarios without real-world risk associated with it.\\nAn example is a retail company setting up yet a new store layout and simulating how customers would have behaved.\\n2. Monte Carlo Simulations: Welcoming Randomness into Predictions\\nMonte Carlo Simulation is another major pillar of Data Farming, using Monte Carlo random sampling to estimate\\nprobabilities and describe uncertainties. Named after the well-known casino in Monaco, this method runs very often\\n(thousands or millions) iterations to derive a predictive picture of possible outcomes.\\nHow It Works:\\nCubicle input variables are assigned a certain probability distribution (for example, ‚ÄúWhat if sales go between 5 and 20\\npercent?‚Äù).\\nWithin the given intervals, the system creates random values and produces results.\\nAfter thousands of runs, it makes possible a statistical distribution of results.\\nReal-World Applications:\\nFinance: Investment risk and portfolio performance evaluation.\\nEngineering: Study on durability of product under stress conditions.\\nHealthcare: Estimate average success rates of new therapies.\\nMonte Carlo Simulation makes Data Farming very much effective for risk analysis. For example, an insurance company could\\npredict claim probabilities for different disaster scenarios.\\n3. Synthetic Data Generation: Datasets of AI\\xa0\\nArtificially constructed data has become a game-changer in Data Farming, as privacy laws like GDPR severely restrict the use\\nof actual data. This involves the generation of artificial data using AI (and especially via Generative Adversarial Networks, or\\nGANs) that appears to be derived from actual data.\\xa0\\nHow It Works:\\nAI models would learn the pattern of actual data and generate an entirely new data set but statistically similar.\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

A bank could\\ngenerate millions of synthetic transactions to test fraud detection systems‚Äîwithout putting real customer data at risk.\\xa0\\n4. Scenario Testing & Digital Twins: VIRTUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF REAL SYSTEMS\\xa0\\nScenario testing through digital twins is the newest and cream of the crop in Data Farming. This is by far one of the latest\\nways to do Data Farming via scenario testing using digital twins, which are virtual representations of physical systems that\\nare updated in real time. Using this ‚Äútwins,‚Äù companies can play with different strategies before they actually implement\\nthem.\\xa0\\nHow It Works:\\xa0\\nA digital twin, created with such a level of live data input, is a simulation of a real-world system (e.g. factory, supply\\nchain, or even a city).\\xa0\\nCompanies then run ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios (i.e., ‚ÄúWhat if we double demand?‚Äù) to see what potential impacts may be.\\xa0\\nFilling the model with real-time data from IoT sensors creates robustness for accuracy.\\xa0\\nReal-World Applications:\\xa0\\nManufacturing: Virtualizing a series of changes in production lines to optimize their configuration.\\xa0\\nSmart Cities: Simulating traffic, energy consumption, and emergency responses.\\xa0\\nAerospace: Predicting the need for maintenance of aircraft before failures occur.\\xa0\\nDigital twins take Data Farming to the next level by fusing real-world data and predictive simulations. For example, an airline\\ncould use a digital twin to test fuel efficiency strategies before implementing them fleet-wide.\\xa0\\n5. Evolutionary Algorithms: Data Optimization through AI ‚ÄúNatural Selection‚Äù\\xa0\\nEvolutionary algorithms are inspired by Darwin‚Äôs principle of evolution; it is one technique of Data Farming in which solutions\\nare ‚Äúevolved‚Äù over generations with AI. Depending on the rules of mutation and combining data models, the algorithms were\\nfound best for producing the best ideal outcome.\\xa0\\nHow It Works:\\xa0\\nStart with a population of random solutions.\\xa0\\n‚ÄúMutations‚Äù and ‚Äúcrossbreeds‚Äù them.\\xa0\\nOnly the best performing models survive and reproduce.\\xa0\\nRepeat until an optimal solution emerges.\\xa0\\nReal-World Applications:\\xa0\\nLogistics: Finding the most efficient delivery routes.\\xa0\\nDrug Discovery: Simulating chemical compounds to identify potential medicines.\\xa0\\nGame AI: Developing NPC behaviors that are smarter by using simulated evolution.\\xa0\\nEvolutionary algorithms make Data Farming very elastic. For instance, a delivery logistics company can adopt this method in\\nestablishing the optimal delivery routes within dynamically changing traffic conditions.\\nJoin our Data Science \\xa0Telegram channel for exclusive updates and tips!\\nWhich Data Farming Technique to Employ?\\nChoosing the right Data Farming technique is contingent upon the purpose:\\n1. Need to imitate the human? ‚Üí Agent-Based Modeling\\n2. Unsure of something? ‚Üí Monte Carlo Simulations\\n3. No real data? ‚Üí Synthetic Data Generation\\n4. Real-world systems tested? ‚Üí Digital Twins\\n5. Complex problems optimized? ‚Üí Evolutionary Algorithms\\nAs Data Farming keeps evolving, more hybrid techniques would be employed in the future-data harvesting using a\\ncombination of AI and IoTs and quantum computing.\\nData Farming vs Data Mining: What‚Äôs the Difference?\\nWhile both Data Farming and Data Mining deal with large datasets, their purposes and techniques are quite different\\nsubjects. Data Mining is an analysis query that leads into the finding of hidden patterns, correlations, trends, and so forth in\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\npreexisting data. As if one were sifting through a gold mine, hunting down valuable nuggets.\\nData Farming: Beginning from the bottom up, Data Farming cannot rely on previous data but creates entirely new data sets\\nfrom simulation, AI models, and new synthetic data techniques. This makes Data Farming very applicable in scenarios such as\\nthe testing of autonomous vehicles, where real data tend to be severely limited or too dangerous to collect.\\nAnother difference lies in scalability. Data Mining is limited by the amount of available data in a raw form, while with Data\\nFarming, one can define any number of data sets using parameters. Though, of course, both actually complement each other-\\none gives the real data insights, and the other valuable experimental opportunities without real-world limitations.\\nContemporary Applications in Data Farming Across\\nIndustries\\xa0\\nData Farming has been changing the face of industries by empowering solutions without the geographical constraints of\\nconventional data collection process. For instance, researchers in health use Data Farming to simulate doses of potential\\ndrugs. State-of-the-art methods in disease spread simulation accelerate breakthroughs in medicine.\\nData Farming finds its place in risk assessment, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and much more in the financial field.\\nBanks, for example, will generate synthetic market data in order to test their trading strategies under different economic\\nconditions ‚Äì all without putting real capital at risk. Typical examples of the application of Data Farming include retail and e-\\ncommerce companies, which use the data as first steps in modeling customer behavior, attribute-based pricing optimization,\\nand demand forecasting.\\nIt is good for self-driving cars, as Data Farming is given importance in training purposes. There is a little way that can be done\\nby relying just on real-world test drives, which are tiresome and hazardous. So what these companies do is create the virtual\\nenvironments where millions of driving scenarios are captured.\\nThe Future of Data Farming: Emerging Opportunities\\nData Farming becomes the coveting tool with the advancement of AI and computing, and a major opportunity in that context\\nis in tie-up between AI training and reinforcement learning. Data generation through Data Farming would enable different\\ntraining datasets synthesis, which would improve accuracy and adaptability of models.\\nEnergy modeled by climate change and sustainability are other promising areas. By using Data Farming, scientists are able to\\nsimulate environmental alterations, predict occurrence of natural disasters, and test various green energy solutions. All these\\nwould provide a new approach to the tackle of climate challenges through data-driven policy recommendations.\\nThe new frontiers that Data Farming has opened will include the growing metaverse and virtual economies. As the expansion\\nof digital worlds continues, companies will require synthetic data to analyze virtual consumer behavior, build compellingly\\nimmersive experiences, and optimize digital marketplaces.\\xa0\\nChallenges and Ethical Considerations in Data Farming\\xa0\\nData Farming has its own challenges that hinder the tremendous promised advantage it would bring about. Data accuracy is\\none challenge. Since synthetic data are generated artificially, its realism and reliability are made prerequisites. Poor Data\\nFarming models lead to biased or misleading results and thus having a severe impact in making decisions.\\nMoreover, privacy comes to play. Although Data Farming does not require much personal data, its misuse of synthetic\\ndatasets may still pose ethical issues. Regulations such as GDPR will need to adapt to the new facets brought about by Data\\nFarming, as well as proper usage of Data Farming to be achieved.\\nAlso, large-scale Data Farming can incur high computational costs. Organizations must weigh the costs of generating and\\nprocessing synthetic data against the possible advantages that could accrue if that data were produced or purchased.\\nHow to Get Started with Data Farming\\xa0\\nFor both students and professionals, Data Farming will definitely be learning a simulation tool like AnyLogic, MATLAB, or any\\nof the frameworks based on Python. Added to the learning mix will be statistical modeling, AI, and machine learning.\\nMany universities and online platforms offer courses on Data Farming, agent-based modeling, and generation of synthetic\\ndata. Hands-on projects can produce practical experience, such as creating simulated market data or training AI with\\nsynthetic datasets.\\xa0\\nCompanies looking into Data Farming should start with pilot projects, testing smaller-scale simulations prior to full-scale\\ninstallation. Data science experts could also be brought on board to optimally tailor their Data Farming strategies for just\\nsuch industry needs.\\xa0\\nWhy Data Farming Is the Future of Data Science ?\\nData Farming is much more than a keyword: it is a game-changing method in generating data in parallel to at-the-place\\nmethods such as Data Mining. Data Farming, through enabling the construction of scalable, customizable datasets,\\nempowers industries to innovate, predict, and optimize like never before.\\xa0\\nAs virtual worlds, big data, and AI grow and develop, the role of Data Farming will pave the way for a much brighter future.\\nToday, a student, a researcher, or a business leader preparing themselves to understand Data Farming is definitely preparing\\nhimself or herself for the data-driven opportunities of tomorrow.\\xa0\\nAlso Read:\\n1.

Understand Your Target Audience\\nIdentify where your audience spends time online. Use tools like Google Analytics and social listening to find out which\\nplatforms are most popular with your target group. For example, TikTok is great for reaching Gen Z, while Facebook appeals\\nto a broader age range.\\n3. Assess Your Content Capabilities\\nThink about the type of content you can create.

Consider your team‚Äôs ability to produce content consistently.\\n4. Analyze Competitor Activity\\nCheck where your competitors are active and what kind of content is performing well. Tools like BuzzSumo or Brandwatch\\ncan help you see which platforms are driving the most engagement for others in your industry.\\n5.

The following are some content\\ntypes to consider:\\nShort-Form Videos (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts): Great for quick tutorials, product teasers, and trends.\\nThey‚Äôre mobile-friendly and drive high engagement.\\nImages & Carousels (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn): Ideal for product shots, infographics, and quotes. They‚Äôre easy to\\nconsume and visually appealing.\\nEducational Content (LinkedIn, YouTube, Threads): Useful for sharing tips, guides, and industry insights. Helps build\\nauthority and trust with your audience.\\nPolls & Quizzes (Instagram Stories, LinkedIn, X): Encourages interaction and feedback, boosting visibility and\\nengagement.\\nUser-Generated Content (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook): Customer reviews and testimonials build trust and show\\nreal-life experiences.\\nText-Based Posts (LinkedIn, Threads, X): Perfect for sharing news, thoughts, and updates, sparking discussions and\\nshowcasing expertise.\\nLong-Form Videos (YouTube, LinkedIn): Best for in-depth content like webinars and tutorials, offering value and\\nengagement.\\nBy matching content types with platforms, you can maximize your reach and connect better with your audience.\\nObjectives of a Social Media Strategy\\nA social media strategy should have clear goals to align with your business targets.

What are the Scrum events?\\nWhat Is Scrum Methodology?\\nScrum is an efficient method or framework used to develop, deliver and maintain complex\\nproducts and that too especially in software development. Sprints in Scrum methodology such\\nas teamwork, accountability and step by step progress in a structured cycle known as ‚ÄúSprint‚Äù.\\nScrum allows teams to be more flexible, collaborate and focused on delivering value in faster\\ndeadlines. This framework proves to be the best in fast changing environments.\\xa0\\nRead More:\\xa0The Ultimate Guide to Agile Product Management\\nFeatures of Scrum Methodology\\nScrum methodology has a number of features, some of them are listed below.\\nScrum organises all major work into short cycles also known as Scrum. It takes only 2-4\\nweeks. Each Spring is responsible to deliver a small usable part of the product.\\nScrum has three main roles i,e. Product owner, Scrum master, Development Team\\nThe product Backlog is set on priority in Scrum methodology. The Product Owner\\nmanages and updates the backlog regularly.\\nEach day there is a quick meeting to get updated on whatever is being done a day\\nbefore.\\nSpring planning is done before each sprint while the sprint review at the end of the day\\ntakes notes whether or not the planned sprint is completed.\\nScrum delivers small usable parts daily i,e. Incremental progress. This reduces the risk\\nof\\xa0 failure by a significant amount.\\nScrum exhibits flexibility and adaptability. With feedback being one of the important\\nparts, adaptation to changes becomes easy.\\nScrum ensures that the most important features are prioritised earlier\\xa0 i,e. Customer\\npriorities.\\nWhat Problem Does Scrum Solve?\\nScrum plays a very significant role in managing complex and fast paced projects especially in\\nsoftware and product development. Well when it comes to the point that Scrum solves in\\nproduct development life cycle, then check a quick check. Traditional project management\\nmethods face a major setback in the following given below.\\nChanging requirements frequently becomes a tedious task with traditional project\\nmanagement.\\nWhen projects are large it becomes tedious to handle the problem.\\nTeams often work in silos and in poor coordination\\xa0\\nThere is often a huge delay in the delivery of the final product to the customers.\\nWhat Changes with Scrum?\\nScrum helps teams build better products faster by staying adaptable, flexible and focused.\\xa0\\nWith Scrum the entire product development cycle is broken into small and manageable\\nchunks i,e. Sprints\\nRegular collaborations and communication is given more priority\\nChanges at any point during development are quick based on users feedback.\\nFinal product delivery is often on time or sometimes before too.\\nScrum Artifacts: An Overview\\nScrum artifacts are the key tools that help teams manage work and track progress throughout\\nthe development journey of the scrum project. Check the three important Scrum artefacts\\nbelow.\\n1. Product Backlog\\nThe product backlog in Scrum is everything which needs to be fixed, such as features, fixes,\\ntechnical tasks, and ideas. These product backlogs are generally provided using feedback\\nfrom users.\\xa0This is prioritised by the product owner. These product backlogs keep on changing\\nwith time and the product team keeps checking on these backlogs in each round.\\xa0\\nProduct owner is responsible for creating, managing and prioritising the backlog.\\nIt is basically dynamic as it changes based on the market needs and trends.\\nIt is regularly refined on a continuous basis with the product owner and team\\ncollaborating to update all details including the estimate and prioritization based on\\nproduct value.\\n2. Sprint Backlog\\nThe Spring backlog consists of a list of tasks from users basically selected from the product\\nbacklogs which are to be completed in the current sprint. It breaks down each task into\\nactionable items and helps the team stay focused and organized during that Sprint.\\nSprint backlog are commitments teams take to complete in the current sprint.\\xa0\\nSprint is basically a subset of product backlog items that teams commit to implement in\\none sprint cycle.\\xa0\\nComplete focus is on how the team works on the deliverable in one sprint.\\n3. Increment\\nAn increment is the stage or working piece of the product delivered at the end of a sprint. It\\nincludes that all the items from the sprint must meet the quality standards and with each\\nincrement product moves one step closer to completion.\\nIt is the work delivered at every sprint.\\nIncrement is a sum of all capabilities delivered which was delivered in the previous\\nsprint completely as a part of the PI.\\xa0\\nAt the end of each sprint, the product owner gets to decide whether to release the\\nincrement or wait until the next release.\\xa0\\nWhat are Scrum Roles?\\nScrum defines three basic roles to form a complete cross functional team with each role\\nhaving the responsibility of ensuring smooth project run and value to the customers.\\n1. Product Owner\\nThe product owner is the main responsible person who defines and prioritises whatever the\\nteam needs to build. They are responsible for managing the product backlog making sure that\\nit is clear, current and perfectly aligned with the customer needs and the goals of the\\nbusiness.\\xa0\\nThey act as the representor of customers making sure that the team works on the most\\nvaluable features based on customers needs and preferences. Product owners tend to\\nmaximize the product value by deciding the workflow of the product.\\nAct as a guide who tells the team on which features to deliver next\\nThey bridge the gap between whatever it is that the business wants and the\\nunderstanding on the team sides.\\nThey decide when and how frequent releases can take place.\\n2. Scrum Master (Leader)\\nThe Scrum Master is the coach personnel in the product development journey or say scrum\\nmethodology. Scrum master is basically the guardian of the team looking out for everyone and\\nmaking sure that everyone follows the scrum principles and removing any bottlenecks which\\nslow down the product progress.\\xa0\\nThe scrum master provides support to both development teams as well as the product owners\\nbut is not directly managing the team. They just help the team stay productive and remove\\nblocks (if any)\\nThey schedule the resources required for each sprint\\nThey also facilitate various sprint events and meeting with the teams\\nThey facilitate any kind of team training required while adopting new practices or\\ntechnology\\n3. Development Team\\nThe Development team consists of a group of professionals who are responsible for designing,\\ntesting, building and delivering the product. They are the professionals who actually work on\\nthe product with all the technical and other skills required to complete it on time.\\xa0\\nThe development team decides how to get the work done i,e. The workflow in each sprint. All\\nthey need to do is to deliver a usable product increment at the end of each sprint.\\nThey work in collaboration to ensure successful sprint completion\\nThey implement sustainable development practices.\\xa0\\nThey also plan and estimate the work they can complete in each sprint.\\nRead More:\\xa0Top 3 Freelance Sites For Web Developers Web Developers In India: Get A\\nChance To Earn ‚Çπ1L+/Month\\nWhat are Scrum Events?\\nScrum events are structured or planned meetings which bring complete transparency and\\ndecide the workflow of each sprint in the scrum process. Every Scrum event has its own\\npurpose to help the team deliver an efficient end product at the end.\\n1. Sprint Planning\\nThis scrum event is concerned with the team estimating the work or tasks to be completed in\\nthe next sprint. The team members define the sprint goals, measurable, and more.\\xa0\\nAt the end of the planning every team member has a clear idea of how each increment can be\\ndelivered in the sprint. The product owner presents the high priority items from the product\\nbacklog and team selects what they can commit for the next sprint.\\n2. Sprint\\nSprint is the time period or core cycle of scrum which usually takes around 2 to 4 weeks long\\nduring which a small portion of the product is designed, developed and delivered. The\\nduration of the sprint clearly depends on the complexity of the work.\\n3. Daily Scrum (Stand Up)\\nThe daily scrum is a short or 15 minutes daily meeting where the development team gets to\\ndiscuss their deliverables yesterday and what they will be doing today. They also notify the\\nblockers in the process (if any). This helps everyone stay on the same page and focus on the\\nsprint goal as a whole.\\n4. Sprint Review\\nAt the end of each sprint the team needs to take a walk through the tasks completed in the\\nsprint. A complete feedback is collected and the product backlog might be updated based on\\nthe customer needs. The major goal of this scrum event is to count progress and collect\\nfeedback to improve the product.\\n5. Sprint Retrospective\\nIn this stage the team comes together to discuss what worked and what needs to be improved\\nincluding the things that didn‚Äôt work in favor during the sprint. Ideas collected from the team\\nto improve the upcoming sprints.\\nAlso Read:\\n1. Product Specs | Definition and Overview\\n2. What is Product Pricing? Objectives, Types, and Factors\\n3.

Why is data mining important?\\n5.4. Q4. What are data mining tools?\\n\\nWhat is Data Mining?\\n\\nData mining is a multi-step process of extracting knowledge from large datasets or databases. The data collected is passed\\nthrough a series of steps including data preprocessing, data transformation, data mining, pattern evaluation, knowledge\\n\\nrepresentation, knowledge refinement, etc.\\n\\n \\n\\nData mining is used to evaluate patterns and uncover hidden trends for businesses. It also helps in fraud detection,\\n\\nmarketing, customer behavior patterns, and more. Social media also uses data mining to select the products in trending.\\n\\nAlso, check What is Data Visualization and its uses?\\n\\nData Mining Techniques\\n\\nData mining uses various techniques and algorithms to convert a large amount of data into an organized format and\\n\\nanalyse them for output.\\n\\n1. Association Rules\\n\\nThe association rule is used to discover relationships between variables based on market analysis in large datasets. It\\ngenerally connects frequent item sets and generates rules to find connections between them. Common algorithms used\\n\\nwith this technique are the Apriori algorithm, the Eclat algorithm, FP-growth, etc.\\n\\nFor example, to determine a company‚Äôs performance, association rules will collect various information and determine\\n\\nfactors to determine its performance and forecast.\\nUses\\n\\n¬¢ Market based analysis\\ne Recommendation system\\n\\ne Analyse user navigation patterns on websites.\\n\\n2. Classification\\n\\n83.\\n\\nClassification is a supervised learning technique used to predict and observations based on old data. A large labeled\\ndataset is trained to create a discrete outcome variable. This technique is used to underlying data in a more organised\\n\\nmanner.\\n\\nSome of the common algorithms used in classification are K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic regression, Decision trees,\\n\\nSupport Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, etc.\\nUses\\n\\n¬¢ Itcan be used as a spad detector.\\ne Used to categorise customers based on their purchasing patterns and behaviour.\\n\\n¬¢ Predicting disease based on the patient data\\n\\n3. Regression\\n\\n \\n\\nRegression is a supervised learning technique used to predict continuous numerical value based on the input variables. It\\n\\nis used to establish relationships among variables.\\n\\nSome of the common algorithms used in these data mining techniques are linear regression, support vector regression,\\n\\ndecision trees, random forest, polynomial regression, etc.\\nUses\\n\\ne Itcan be used in house price prediction\\n¬¢ Sales forecasting based on historical data\\n¬¢ Stock Market analysis\\n\\n¬¢ Future predictions of stock prices\\n\\n4. Clustering\\n\\n \\n\\nClustering is a data mining technique used to find relationships or connections between objects. It is similar to\\nclassification where objects are labeled and categorized for further analysis. It is an unsupervised learning technique used\\n\\nto group similar data points together based on their similar features without predefined labels.\\nUses\\n\\n¬© Group customers with similar behaviours\\n¬¢ Image divisions into meaningful segments.\\n\\n¬¢ Identify anomalies in data.\\n\\n5. Decision Trees\\n\\n \\n\\nDecision trees are used to predict an outcome based on a set of given criteria. It comprises root, leaf nodes and internal\\nnodes. It is used for classifications as well as regression tasks. It applies a greedy search using divide and conquer\\n\\napproach. It helps in selecting a specific direction in a vast sea of data.\\n\\nUses\\n\\nIt is used in healthcare to diagnose symptoms based on patient data.\\nIt is used in finance to calculate credit scoring and loan approval\\n\\nIt is also used in customer segmentation and targeting\\n\\n¬¢ It is used in quality control and defect detection\\n\\n¬¢ Inventory management and sales forecasting\\n\\n6. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\\n\\n \\n\\nKNN is one of the most popular supervised machine learning algorithms. It uses proximity relations to make classifications\\nor predictions. It assumes the similarity between the new data and available data in almost similar categories.

However, logic programming systems have a logical interpretation,\\nwhereas production systems do not.\\n\\nContents Vv\\n\\n \\n\\n‚Äú Production system rules ce\\n\\nA classic example of a production rule-based system is the domain-specific expert system that uses rules to make\\ndeductions or choices.!] For example, an expert system might help a doctor choose the correct diagnosis based on\\na cluster of symptoms, or select tactical moves to play a game.\\n\\nRule-based systems can be used to perform lexical analysis to compile or interpret computer programs, or in\\n\\nnatural language processing 2]\\n\\nRule-based programming attempts to derive execution instructions from a starting set of data and rules. This is a\\nmore indirect method than that employed by an imperative programming language, which lists execution steps\\nsequentially.\\n\\nConstruction oe\\n\\nA typical rule-based system has four basic components:4)\\n¬´ A list of rules or rule base, which is a specific type of knowledge base.\\n\\n¬´ An inference engine or semantic reasoner, which infers information or takes action based on the interaction of\\ninput and the rule base. The interpreter executes a production system program by performing the following\\nmatch-resolve-act cycle!)\\n\\n¬´ Match: In this first phase, the condition sides of all productions are matched against the contents of working\\nmemory. As a result a set (the conflict set) is obtained, which consists of instantiations of all satisfied\\nproductions. An instantiation of a production is an ordered list of working memory elements that satisfies the\\n\\ncondition side of the production.\\n¬´ Conflict-resolution: In this second phase, one of the production instantiations in the conflict set is chosen for\\n\\nexecution. If no productions are satisfied, the interpreter halts.\\n\\n¬´ Act: In this third phase, the actions of the production selected in the conflict-resolution phase are executed\\nThese actions may change the contents of working memory. At the end of this phase, execution returns to the\\nfirst phase.\\n\\n¬´ Temporary working memory, which is a database of facts.\\n\\n¬´ Auser interface or other connection to the outside world through which input and output signals are received and\\nsent.\\n\\nWhereas the matching phase of the inference engine has a logical interpretation, the conflict resolution and action\\nphases do not. Instead, \"their semantics is usually described as a series of applications of various state-changing\\noperators, which often gets quite involved (depending on the choices made in deciding which ECA rules fire, when,\\nand so forth), and they can hardly be regarded as declarative\", 1]\\n\\n‚Äú Logic programming rules ce\\n\\nThe logic programming family of computer systems includes the programming language Prolog, the database\\nlanguage Datalog and the knowledge representation and problem-solving language Answer Set Programming\\n(ASP). In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:\\n\\nA :- By, ..., Bye\\nand are read as declarative sentences in logical form:\\n\\nA if B, and ... and B,.\\nIn the simplest case of Horn clauses (or \"definite\" clauses), which are a subset of first-order logic, all of the A, Bj, ...,\\n\\nB, are atomic formulae.\\n\\nAlthough Horn clause logic programs are Turing complete &ll7] for many practical applications, it is useful to extend\\nHorn clause programs by allowing negative conditions, implemented by negation as failure. Such extended logic\\nprograms have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\\n\\ns Differences and relationships between production rules and logic\\nprogramming rules\\n\\n.\\n\\nThe most obvious difference between the two kinds of systems is that production rules are typically written in the\\nforward direction, ifA then B, and logic programming rules are typically written in the backward direction, B if A. In\\nthe case of logic programming rules, this difference is superficial and purely syntactic. It does not affect the\\nsemantics of the rules. Nor does it affect whether the rules are used to reason backwards, Prolog style, to reduce\\nthe goal Bto the subgoals A, or whether they are used, Datalog style, to derive B from A.\\n\\nIn the case of production rules, the forward direction of the syntax reflects the stimulus-response character of most\\nproduction rules, with the stimulus A coming before the response B. Moreover, even in cases when the response is\\nsimply to draw a conclusion B from an assumption A, as in modus ponens, the match-resolve-act cycle is restricted\\nto reasoning forwards from A to B. Reasoning backwards in a production system would require the use of an\\nentirely different kind of inference engine.\\n\\nIn his Introduction to Cognitive Science,¬Æl Paul Thagard includes logic and rules as alternative approaches to\\nmodelling human thinking. He does not consider logic programs in general, but he considers Prolog to be, not a\\nrule-based system, but \"a programming language that uses logic representations and deductive techniques\" (page\\n40).\\n\\nHe argues that rules, which have the form /F condition THEN action, are \"very similar\" to logical conditionals, but\\nthey are simpler and have greater psychological plausibility (page 51). Among other differences between logic and\\nrules, he argues that logic uses deduction, but rules use search (page 45) and can be used to reason either forward\\nor backward (page 47). Sentences in logic \"have to be interpreted as universally true‚Äô, but rules can be defaults,\\nwhich admit exceptions (page 44). He does not observe that all of these features of rules apply to logic\\nprogramming systems.\\n\\n~ See also ¬¢\\n\\nLogic programming\\n\\n¬´ Expert systems\\n\\nRewriting\\n\\ne RuleML\\n\\nList of rule-based languages\\n\\nLearning classifier system\\ne Rule-based machine learning\\n\\ne Rule-based modeling\\n\\n~ References ¬¢\\n\\n1.‚Äú Crina Grosan; Ajith Abraham (29 July 2011). /ntelligent Systems: A Modern Approachl.

It\\nproceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item\\nsets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by\\nApriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has\\napplications in domains such as market basket analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nContents A\\nOverview\\n\\nExamples\\nExample 1\\n\\nExample 2\\nLimitations\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nA Overview &\\n\\nThe Apriori algorithm was proposed by Agrawal and Srikant in 1994. Apriori is designed to operate on databases\\ncontaining transactions (for example, collections of items bought by customers, or details of a website\\nfrequentation or IP addresses!2)), Other algorithms are designed for finding association rules in data having no\\ntransactions (Winepi and Minepi), or having no timestamps (DNA sequencing). Each transaction is seen as a set of\\nitems (an itemse?). Given a threshold C,, the Apriori algorithm identifies the item sets which are subsets of at least\\n\\nC transactions in the database.\\n\\nApriori uses a \"bottom up\" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as\\ncandidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no\\nfurther successful extensions are found\\n\\nApriori uses breadth-first search and a Hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates\\ncandidate item sets of length k from item sets of length k ‚Äî 1. Then it prunes the candidates which have an\\ninfrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent k-length\\nitem sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.\\n\\nThe pseudo code for the algorithm is given below for a transaction database T, and a support threshold of ‚Ç¨. Usual\\nset theoretic notation is employed, though note that T‚Äô is a multiset. Cy is the candidate set for level k. At each\\nstep, the algorithm is assumed to generate the candidate sets from the large item sets of the preceding level,\\nheeding the downward closure lemma. count|c] accesses a field of the data structure that represents candidate\\nset ¬¢, which is initially assumed to be zero. Many details are omitted below, usually the most important part of the\\nimplementation is the data structure used for storing the candidate sets, and counting their frequencies.\\n\\nApriori(T, ‚Ç¨)\\nL, ¬´ {large singleton itemsets}\\nko 2\\nwhile L,_, is not empty\\nC, - Generate_candidates(Ly,). k)\\nfor transactions t in T\\nD, ¬´ fe inG, : ¬¢ St}\\nfor candidates c in D,\\n\\ncount[c] + count[c] + 1\\n\\nLy ¬© fe in Cy, : count[c] > ‚Ç¨}\\n\\nke ke 1\\nreturn Union(L,) over all k\\n\\nGenerate_candidates(L, k)\\nresult -‚Äî empty_set()\\nfor all p ¬© L, q ¬© L where p and q differ in exactly one element\\neco pUq\\nif u ¬© L for all u ¬© c where Jul = k-1\\nresult.add(c)\\n\\nreturn result\\n\\n~¬´ Examples ce\\n\\nExample 1 so\\n\\nConsider the following database, where each row is a transaction and each cell is an individual item of the\\ntransaction:\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nalBle\\nalpi6\\nalBle\\nalpi6\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe association rules that can be determined from this database are the following:\\n1. 100% of sets with a also contain B\\n2. 50% of sets with a, B also have ‚Ç¨\\n3. 50% of sets with a, B also have 6\\n\\nwe can also illustrate this through a variety of examples.\\n\\nExample 2 oe\\n\\nAssume that a large supermarket tracks sales data by stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each item: each item, such as\\n\"butter\" or \"bread\", is identified by a numerical SKU. The supermarket has a database of transactions where each\\ntransaction is a set of SKUs that were bought together.\\n\\nLet the database of transactions consist of following itemsets:\\n\\n \\n\\nItemsets\\n\\n \\n\\n{1,2,3,4}\\n{12,4}\\n{1,2}\\n{2,3,4}\\n{2,3}\\n{3,4}\\n{2,4}\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWe will use Apriori to determine the frequent item sets of this database. To do this, we will say that an item set is\\nfrequent if it appears in at least 3 transactions of the database: the value 3 is the support threshold.\\n\\nThe first step of Apriori is to count up the number of occurrences, called the support, of each member item\\nseparately. By scanning the database for the first time, we obtain the following result\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nItem Support\\n{1} |3\\n\\n{2}\\n\\n{3} 4\\n\\n{4 |5\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAll the itemsets of size 1 have a support of at least 3, so they are all frequent.\\nThe next step is to generate a list of all pairs of the frequent items.\\n\\nFor example, regarding the pair {1,2}: the first table of Example 2 shows items 1 and 2 appearing together in three\\nof the itemsets; therefore, we say item {1,2} has support of three.\\n\\n \\n\\nItem Support\\n{1,2}|3\\n{1,3}|1\\n1,4} 2\\n{2,3}|3\\n{2,4})4\\n{3,4}|3\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe pairs {1,2}, {2,3}, {2,4}, and {3,4} all meet or exceed the minimum support of 3, so they are frequent. The pairs\\n{1,3} and {1,4} are not. Now, because {1,3} and {1,4} are not frequent, any larger set which contains {1,3} or {1,4}\\ncannot be frequent. In this way, we can prune sets: we will now look for frequent triples in the database, but we can\\nalready exclude all the triples that contain one of these two pairs:\\n\\n \\n\\nItem Support\\n{2,3,4}|2\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nin the example, there are no frequent triplets. {2,3,4} is below the minimal threshold, and the other triplets were\\nexcluded because they were super sets of pairs that were already below the threshold.\\n\\nWe have thus determined the frequent sets of items in the database, and illustrated how some items were not\\ncounted because one of their subsets was already known to be below the threshold.\\n\\nA Limitations &\\n\\nApriori, while historically significant, suffers from a number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned\\nother algorithms. Candidate generation generates large numbers of subsets (The algorithm attempts to load up the\\ncandidate set, with as many as possible subsets before each scan of the database). Bottom-up subset exploration\\n(essentially a breadth-first traversal of the subset lattice) finds any maximal subset S only after all 2l5| ‚Äî 1 of its\\n\\nproper subsets.\\n\\nThe algorithm scans the database too many times, which reduces the overall performance. Due to this, the\\n\\nalgorithm assumes that the database is permanently in the memory.\\n\\nAlso, both the time and space complexity of this algorithm are very high: O (27), thus exponential, where |D| is\\nthe horizontal width (the total number of items) present in the database.\\n\\nLater algorithms such as Max-Miner¬Æ) try to identify the maximal frequent item sets without enumerating their\\nsubsets, and perform \"jumps\" in the search space rather than a purely bottom-up approach.\\n\\n~ References ¬¢\\n\\n1. * Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant.Fast algorithms for mining association rules 4.

The most common form of\\ncross-validation is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and\\n\\nevaluated k times.\\n\\nHyperparameter Tuning\\n\\nHyperparameters are external configurations that are not learned from the data but significantly impact a model‚Äôs\\nperformance. Tuning these hyperparameters is a critical step in optimising a predictive model. Techniques for\\nhyperparameter tuning involve systematically adjusting the hyperparameter values to find the combination that results in\\n\\nthe best model performance.\\n\\nEnsemble Learning\\n\\nEnsemble learning involves combining predictions from multiple models to create a more robust and accurate model. The\\nidea is that by aggregating the predictions of diverse models, the weaknesses of individual models are mitigated, leading to\\nimproved overall performance. Random Forest, a popular ensemble learning method, builds multiple decision trees and\\n\\ncombines their outputs.\\nModel Interpretability\\n\\nUnderstanding the decisions made by predictive models is crucial, especially in scenarios where the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù nature of\\nsome models may pose challenges in gaining stakeholders‚Äô trust. Model interpretability techniques aim to provide insights\\n\\ninto how a model arrives at a particular prediction.\\n\\nModel Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nSelecting appropriate evaluation metrics is crucial for assessing a model‚Äôs performance accurately. The choice of metrics\\n\\ndepends on the nature of the problem‚Äîclassification, regression, or clustering‚Äîand the specific goals of the modelling\\n\\ntask.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\x0c'}, {'Screenshot_2025-07-27-06-02-15-531_com.android.chrome.jpg': \"6:02 Dom, 27/Jul @ % @-- ooo A eS 70.\\n\\n \\n\\nPagina Inici ¬© Nova guia @ Data Mininc @ TypesOf X @ Offline Dat: +\\n\\naq ‚Ç¨ > G8 pwskills.com/blog/types-of-machi yy <‚Äî @ :\\n\\n@ skitts\\n\\nHome ¬ª Data Science ¬ª Types Of Machine Learning\\n\\n \\n\\nTypes Of Machine Learning\\nBy Varun Saharawat| September 12, 2023\\nThe basic types of Machine Learning include: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Reinforcement Learning, and\\n\\nSemi-Supervised Learning.

What are the types of data models?\\n8.3. What tools are used for data modeling?\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat Is Data Modeling In Software Engineering?\\n\\nData Modeling in software engineering is the process of representing and organizing data structures in a simpler way. It\\nuses diagrams, symbols, and text to represent data and shows how they relate to each other. This process is the first\\n\\nimportant step in defining how data is structured and used in a system.\\n\\nData Modeling involves creating data models that describe how data is connected with each other. These models are then\\neventually used to build databases or update old software systems. By using data modeling, companies ensure\\nconsistency in how data is named, organized, and secured, which ultimately helps in improving their data analysis process.\\n\\nThe main focus is on making data available and well-organized to the team, regardless of how it is applied.\\n\\nTypes Of Data Models\\n\\nDesigning a database or information system starts with a simple idea and gradually becomes more detailed. Data models,\\nwhich represent the structure of the data, can be grouped into three types based on how detailed they are: conceptual,\\n\\nlogical, and physical.\\n\\nThe process usually begins with a conceptual model, then moves to a logical model, and finally ends with a physical model.\\n\\n  \\n\\nLet us understand each of these models in detail with the help of the diagram given below:\\n\\nDrowning in data?\\nWe'll teach you to swim!\\n\\nruy>iwar muucr\\n\\nDescribes the DB implementation\\naol ie Bulle\\n\\nLogical Model\\n\\nDefines the data structure\\nand how it is logically interconnected\\n\\n1] Conceptual Model\\nawa\\n\\nIdentifies business concepts\\n\\n \\n\\nTypes Of Data Models\\n\\n1. Conceptual Data Models\\n\\nThese models are also known as domain models and they basically give an overview of what the system will include, how it\\nwill be organized, and the main business rules involved. Conceptual models are created early in the project to help in\\ngathering requirements. They identify important things that need to be represented in the system, their attributes, and\\nhow they relate to each other. These models also consider security and data integrity, but they are usually simple and\\n\\nstraightforward.\\n\\n2. Logical Data Models\\n\\nLogical models are more detailed than conceptual models. They describe the data and relationships in the system more\\nprecisely, often using formal notation systems. Logical models also define data attributes, such as data types and sizes, but\\n\\nthey don't get into technical system details.\\n\\nThese models are sometimes skipped in agile or DevOps practices but are useful in projects that are data-focused, like\\n\\ndesigning data warehouses or reporting systems.\\n3. Physical Data Models\\n\\nPhysical models are the most detailed data models, they basically show how data will be stored in a database. These\\nmodels provide a final design that can be implemented as a relational database. They include tables that represent\\nrelationships between entities, along with primary and foreign keys to maintain these relationships. Physical models also\\nconsider specific database management system (DBMS) features, such as performance tuning, managing, easy storing,\\n\\nand data retrieval.\\n\\nData Modeling Process\\n\\nData modeling is a method used to understand how data is processed and stored. It involves careful planning of how data\\nwill be represented and how it will meet business needs. Different data modeling techniques use specific symbols and\\nlayouts to show how data is structured. Let us understand the basic steps involved in the data modeling process with the\\n\\nhelp of the steps written below:\\n\\n1. Identify Entities: The very first step of data modeling process is to start by identifying the key things, events, or\\nconcepts in the data set. These are called entities, and each one should be different from the others.\\n\\n2. Identify Key Properties: As we have talked above that each entity in the data set must have unique characteristics\\nknown as attributes. Your main work in this step is to find those unique attributes for an entity. For example, a\\n‚Äúcustomer‚Äù entity may have attributes like first name, last name, and phone number, while an ‚Äúaddress‚Äù entity may\\n\\ninclude a street name, city, and zip code.\\n\\nwo\\n\\n. Identify Relationships: In the next step, determine how these entities relate to each other. For example, a customer\\nmay have a permanent address and an order may be shipped to a different address labeled as ‚Äúoffice address‚Äù.\\nThese relationships are often shown using diagrams like Unified Modeling Language (UML).\\n\\n4. Map Attributes: In this step, Your job is to make sure that all attributes are properly connected to their entities.\\nThis step ensures that the data model accurately represents how the business will use the data. Various patterns\\ncan be used for this purpose depending on the needs of the business.\\n\\n5. Assign Keys and Normalize Data: In this step, you will assign unique identifiers, or keys, to link related data without\\nduplicating information. This step, known as normalization will help in reducing the storage space but may affect\\nhow quickly the data can be accessed.\\n\\n6. Finalize and Validate: Finally, In the last step, review and refine the data model to make sure it meets business\\n\\nneeds. This process should be repeated as there might be data that needs to be changed over time.\\n\\nThis approach helps in creating a clear and organized structure for data, making it easier to manage and use.\\n\\nTypes Of Data Modeling\\n\\nIn today‚Äôs time, Data modeling has evolved a lot with database systems. With the passage of time, it has become more\\ncomplex as data storage needs have grown. Here are some of the common types of data models that are widely used by\\n\\ncompanies to fulfill their needs and demands:\\n\\nRelational\\n\\nData\\nModeling\\nTechniques\\n\\n‚Äú\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\nObject\\nOriented\\n\\n1. Hierarchical data models organize data in a tree-like structure, showing one-to-many relationships. Each record has a\\nsingle root or parent that connects to one or more child tables. This model was first used in the IBM Information\\n\\nManagement System (IMS) in 1966, especially in banking.\\n\\nWhile it is less efficient as compared to newer models, it is still used in systems like Extensible Markup Language (XML)\\n\\nand geographic information systems (GIS).\\n\\n2. Relational data models were introduced by IBM researcher E.F. Codd in 1970 and are still widely used today. They\\norganize data in tables where data segments are joined, making database management simpler. Relational databases often\\nuse structured query language (SQL) to manage data. These databases are effective at maintaining data accuracy and\\n\\nreducing redundancy, making them ideal for transaction processing system.\\n\\n3. Entity-relationship (ER) data models basically use diagrams to show the relationships between entities in a database.\\n\\nData architects use ER modeling tools to create visual maps that help in designing databases.\\n\\n4. Object-oriented data models became popular in the mid-1990s with the rise of object-oriented programming. In these\\nmodels, ‚Äúobjects‚Äù represent real-world entities which are grouped into class hierarchies with associated features. Object-\\noriented databases can handle complex data relationships and are used in multimedia, hypertext databases, and other\\n\\nadvanced applications.\\n\\n5. Dimensional data models were developed by Ralph Kimball to speed up data retrieval in data warehouses. Unlike\\nrelational and ER models, which focus on efficient storage, dimensional models prioritize quick access to information, even\\n\\nif it promotes redundancy. These models are commonly used in online analytical processing (OLAP) systems.\\n\\nAdvantages Of Data Modeling\\n\\nData modeling is a key part of building software or database systems. It offers several benefits and features which include:\\n\\n1. Better Understanding of Data: Data modeling shows how data is organized and connected, which helps people in\\nmaking better decisions about how to use and store it.\\n\\n2. Better Data Quality: By finding mistakes and inconsistencies in data, data modeling improves the overall quality of\\nthe data and prevents issues.\\n\\n3. Better Collaboration: It helps everyone involved in the development process to communicate more effectively,\\nleading to better decisions and outcomes.\\n\\n4. Increased Efficiency: Data modeling makes the development process smoother by providing a clear view of the\\n\\ndata for software developers and other team members.\\n\\nData Modeling Tools\\n\\nToday, many tools help with designing and managing computer systems, these data modeling tools are available in both\\n\\nways- paid and free. Here are a few examples of data modeling tools that you can use during your development phase:\\n\\n1. erwin Data Modeler: This tool helps in creating data models in an effective way. It uses a specific method called\\nIDEF 1X but also supports other crucial methods.\\n\\n2. Enterprise Architect: This tool helps in visualizing and designing both enterprise systems and software. It follows\\nobject-oriented standards and is widely used across many industries.\\n\\n3. ER/Studio: This is a database design tool that works with many popular databases. It supports in designing of both\\nrelational and dimensional data.\\n\\n4. Open ModelSphere: This is a free, open-source tool for data modeling that is widely used by small businesses to\\nmanage their data effectively. If you are looking for a free tool to learn or understand data modeling process that\\n\\nthis tool could be the best fit for you.\\n\\x0c\"}, {'Screenshot_2025-07-27-06-23-23-548_com.android.chrome.jpg': '6:23 Dom, 27/Jul fi @ @ -- ceo 2S 68x\\n\\n \\n\\nPagina Inici ¬© Nova guia @ DataLak xX ¬© Types Of M @ Offline Dat: +\\n\\nQO ‚Ç¨ > G_ 8g pwskills.com/blog/data-lake-vs-de yy <‚Äî @¬© :\\n\\nKey Differences: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse\\n\\nThere is more to the real difference between data lake vs. data warehouse:\\n\\nA data lake accepts all types of input (structured/unstructured), while a warehouse needs to have a clean input\\n\\nstructure.\\n\\nCosts of storage: Storing large amounts in a data lake will usually be much cheaper, while warehouses can be even\\nmore expensive on account of their processing needs.\\n\\ne Users: More attractive to the data scientists, while analysts and business users will probably use the warehouse.\\n\\nUse Case: Use data lakes for predictive analysis, while data warehouses serve more for historical reporting.\\n\\ne Data Processing: Process after storage in a lake.

It defines how the data is stored,\\nmanaged, and retrieved from a database. It defines the relationship between different entities in a database and determines\\nthe constraints for security purposes. Some important types of data architecture are given here.\\nClient-server database architecture\\nDistributed database architecture\\nCloud database architecture\\xa0\\nCentralised database architecture\\nThe type of database to be chosen depends on the requirements of the project at hand, the amount of data stored,\\naccessibility, performance and others.\\nDatabase Three Schema Architecture\\nIn a DBMS, the data architecture is divided into three major types.\\xa0\\n1. Tier I\\nThe tier I database architecture is directly available to the user. Any change in the data will be done on the database itself.\\nHere, the programmers directly communicate with the database for local applications such as those from colleges, private\\nfirms, etc.\\xa0\\n2. Tier II\\nThe Tier II database architecture is not directly available to the user. Still, they can communicate via an application on the\\nclient end, which connects with the database on the server side. The user interface and application program run on the client\\nside.\\nBanks are the real-world example of a Tier II database architecture. The database in Tier II can be accessed through APIs,\\nsuch as JDBC, ODBC, etc.\\n3. Tier III\\nIn Tier III database architecture, there is a third layer between client and server. A client cannot communicate directly with\\nthe server. However, applications on the client side interact with an application server to communicate with the database.\\ndata architecture\\nThe user at the client end has yet to learn about the existence of a database beyond the application server. They are usually\\nemployed for large web applications.\\nWhat Is Database In SQL\\nA database in SQL is a collection of tables which store data in an organised manner.

Boyce developed ‚ÄúSEQUEL‚Äù ‚Äì A Structured English Query Language.\\xa0\\nThe goal was to create a standardized language that can manage and retrieve data stored in relational databases. SEQUEL\\nwas initially designed to work with IBM‚Äôs System R, one of the first prototypes of a relational database management system\\n(RDBMS).\\nIn 1979, SQL‚Äôs commercial potential became apparent, and the first SQL-based RDBMS, Oracle, was released by the Oracle\\nCorporation. Over the years, SQL became the standard language for interacting with relational databases, with its first\\nstandardization occurring in 1986 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and later by the International\\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.\\nSince then, SQL has evolved with various updates and extensions, maintaining its status as the dominant database language.\\nIt has remained foundational to modern data management systems, with widespread adoption across different industries,\\nfrom finance to healthcare, cementing its importance in the history of computing.\\nSQL Commands\\nSQL (Structured Query Language) commands play an important role in manipulating and managing relational databases,\\noffering plenty of functionalities to interact with data effectively. Let us explore some key SQL commands and their\\nfunctionalities in detail:\\nImage Source\\n1) SQL SELECT\\nFunctionality: It enables users to retrieve specific data or entire datasets from a set of multiple tables based on\\nspecified criteria.\\nUsage: It is often employed for generating reports, extracting insights, and performing data analysis by filtering and\\nselecting relevant data subsets.\\nSyntax Example\\nSELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE category = ‚ÄòElectronics‚Äô;\\xa0\\n2) SQL CREATE\\nFunctionality: It helps in the creation of databases, tables, indexes, and other database objects.\\nUsage: Essential for database administrators and developers to define the structure, relationships, and constraints of\\ndatabase objects.\\nExample For Creating a Table\\nCREATE TABLE Customers ( customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_name VARCHAR(50), email VARCHAR(100) );\\n3) SQL DELETE\\nFunctionality: It removes specific records or rows from a table based on specified conditions.\\nUsage: This hels in data cleanup, removal of obsolete records, and maintenance of database integrity.\\nExample of Deleting a particular Order Data From Order Column\\nDELETE FROM Orders WHERE order_date < ‚Äò2022-01-01‚Äô;\\xa0\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\n4) SQL INSERT INTO\\nFunctionality: Inserts new records or rows into a table with specified column values.\\nUsage: Essential for adding new data entries, updating catalogs, and maintaining up-to-date information within tables.\\nExample Of Inserting a New Record into products table\\nINSERT INTO Products (product_name, price) VALUES (‚ÄòLaptop‚Äô, 1200);\\xa0\\n5) SQL UPDATE\\nFunctionality: Modifies existing records or rows within a table based on specified conditions.\\nUsage: Facilitates data modification, correction of errors, and updating records to reflect changes in business\\nprocesses or requirements.\\nExample Of Updating Department Of An Employee\\nUPDATE Employees SET department = ‚ÄòIT‚Äô WHERE employee_id = 101;\\xa0\\n6) SQL JOIN\\nFunctionality: Combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns to retrieve data in a unified result\\nset.\\nUsage: Enables data integration, relationship establishment between tables, and extraction of comprehensive\\ndatasets.\\nExample Of Combining Customer Record\\nSELECT Orders.order_id, Customers.customer_name FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id =\\nCustomers.customer_id;\\xa0\\n7) SQL DROP\\nFunctionality: Eliminates existing databases, tables, views, indexes, or other database objects.\\nUsage: Essential for database maintenance, restructuring, and removal of redundant or obsolete objects.\\nExample Of Eliminating a Table if Different One Exists\\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;\\xa0\\nHow Does SQL Work?\\nStructured Query Language operates as a powerful tool for managing and handling data in relational databases.\\nUnderstanding how SQL works involves diving into its core functionalities, components, and operations. Here is an overview\\nof how SQL works:\\n1) Definition and Structure\\nSQL serves as a standardized programming language designed specifically for managing relational databases. It encompasses\\na structured syntax comprising various statements, commands, and clauses tailored for data definition, manipulation,\\nretrieval, and control.\\n2) Database Creation and Design\\nSQL enables users to define the logical structure of databases, including tables, relationships, constraints, indexes, views, and\\nschemas. Database administrators and developers utilize SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands like CREATE,\\nALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE to create and modify database objects.\\n3) Data Manipulation\\nSQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands facilitate the insertion, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data\\nwithin tables. Commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE empower users to interact with database records,\\napply filters, sort data, and perform aggregate functions.\\n4) Data Retrieval and Querying\\nSQL excels in retrieving specific data subsets from vast databases through structured queries. The SELECT statement serves\\nas a cornerstone for formulating queries, enabling users to extract, filter, and aggregate data based on specified criteria,\\nconditions, and relationships.\\n5) Data Integrity and Constraints\\nSQL helps in promoting data integrity through the implementation of constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, unique\\nconstraints, not null constraints, and check constraints. These constraints enforce rules, relationships, and validations within\\ntables, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and reliability.\\n6) Transaction Management\\nSQL Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands facilitate transaction management, ensuring data consistency and\\nreliability. Commands such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT enable users to manage transaction boundaries, roll\\nback erroneous operations, and maintain database integrity despite system failures or interruptions.\\n7) Optimization and Performance\\nSQL provides mechanisms to optimize database performance through data modeling, indexing, query optimization,\\nexecution plans, and performance tuning. Database administrators leverage tools, techniques, and best practices to enhance\\nquery execution, reduce response times, and optimize resource utilization.\\n8) Security and Access Control\\nSQL incorporates robust security mechanisms to safeguard sensitive data, restrict unauthorized access, and ensure\\ncompliance with regulatory standards. SQL Data Control Language (DCL) commands like GRANT and REVOKE enable\\nadministrators to define user privileges, roles, and permissions, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\\nComponents of SQL System\\nSQL systems are an important part of relational database management which includes distinct components that help in\\nfacilitating efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. Let us dive further into the topic to see what are these integral\\ncomponents of SQL systems:\\n1) SQL Schema\\nDefinition: An SQL schema represents the logical structure, design, and organization of the database, defining tables,\\nfields, relationships, constraints, and more.\\nExample: In designing an e-commerce platform, an SQL schema might include tables such as Users, Products, Orders,\\nand Payments, outlining their respective attributes and relationships.\\n2) Indexes\\nDefinition: Indexes enhance database performance by accelerating data retrieval operations. They provide quick\\naccess to specific data within a table, reducing the time required for query execution.\\nExample: A unique index on the User_ID column within the Users table ensures rapid retrieval of user-specific data,\\noptimizing system responsiveness.\\n3) Constraints\\nDefinition: Constraints impose rules and conditions on data columns within tables, ensuring data integrity,\\nconsistency, and accuracy. Common constraints include primary keys, foreign keys, unique, not null, and check\\nconstraints.\\nExample: A foreign key constraint linking the Order_ID column in the Orders table to the User_ID column in the Users\\ntable maintains referential integrity between related data entities.\\n4) Triggers\\nDefinition: Triggers are specialized stored procedures that automatically execute in response to specific events or\\nactions within the database, such as data modifications, insertions, or deletions.\\nExample: A trigger might activate upon the insertion of a new record into the Payments table, automatically updating\\nthe Total_Sales column in the Analytics table.\\n5) Views\\nDefinition: Views present a virtual representation of data derived from one or multiple tables, tailored to meet\\nspecific user requirements or application needs. They simplify complex queries, enhance data security, and provide a\\ncustomizable perspective of the database.\\nExample: A view named High_Value_Customers might aggregate data from the Users and Orders tables, displaying\\ninformation solely about customers with a purchase history exceeding a specified value.\\n6) Transactions\\nDefinition: Transactions encapsulate a sequence of SQL operations, ensuring data consistency, reliability, and\\natomicity. Transactions adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data\\nintegrity despite system failures or interruptions.\\nExample: A banking application might employ transactions to ensure that fund transfers between accounts occur\\natomically, maintaining accurate account balances and transaction histories.\\n7) Backup and Recovery\\nDefinition: Backup and recovery mechanisms safeguard critical database information, enabling data restoration in the\\nevent of system failures, errors, or disasters. SQL systems offer robust backup strategies, including full, differential,\\nand incremental backups, coupled with recovery options to mitigate data loss risks.\\nExample: Regularly scheduled backups of an e-commerce database ensure the availability of historical data,\\ntransaction records, and customer information, facilitating rapid recovery and continuity in unforeseen circumstances.\\nAlso read: SQL For Data Analytics: A Comprehensive Guide\\nAlso read: SQL vs NoSQL: 5 Critical Differences You Should Know\\nSQL Injection\\nSQL injection (SQLi) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can insert or ‚Äúinject‚Äù malicious SQL code\\ninto a query, thereby gaining unauthorized access to a database or executing unintended commands.

How do Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing differ from one another?\\n1.3.11. 26. What distinguishes descriptive statistics from inferential statistics?\\n1.3.12. 27. Describe the machine learning notion of overfitting.\\n1.3.13. 28. What distinguishes supervised from unsupervised learning?\\n1.3.14. 29. What do you understand by Cross-Validation?\\n1.3.15. 30. How can we use Excel in data analysis?\\n1.3.16. 31. In Excel, how do you make a pivot table?\\n1.3.17. 32. What does Excel conditional formatting mean?\\nThe answer is that relational databases are managed and worked on using the computer language SQL (Structured Query\\nLanguage). It is crucial for data analysis because it enables analysts to extract, alter, and analyze data, run complicated\\nqueries, and aggregate and summarize data for reporting and analytical needs.\\n6. In SQL, how do INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN differ from one another?\\nAn inner join only returns rows with matching values in the two connected tables, as opposed to an outer join, which returns\\nall rows from one table and matching rows from the other. OUTER JOIN can be further broken down into the subcategories\\nof LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, depending on whether the table‚Äôs data is included.\\n7. How can you use SQL to search for duplicate records in a table?\\nThe GROUP BY and HAVING clauses may be used to identify duplicate data. Here is a sample inquiry:\\nSELECT column1, column2, COUNT() FROM table_name GROUP BY column1, column2, AND COUNT() > 1 IN column1,\\ncolumn2.\\nBased on the chosen columns, duplicate records will be shown.\\n8. What do the terms ‚Äúprimary key‚Äù and ‚Äúforeign key‚Äù mean in SQL?\\nA primary key is a special code that distinguishes each entry in a database. It guarantees data integrity and enables speedy\\ndata retrieval. A field in a table that relates to the primary key of another table is regarded as a foreign key. By creating a\\nconnection between the two tables, it ensures referential integrity.\\n9. Describe the differences between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL.\\nIn contrast to UNION ALL, which combines the result sets without deleting duplicate rows, UNION combines the result sets\\nof two or more SELECT queries. Because it doesn‚Äôt do the duplicate removal procedure, UNION ALL is quicker than UNION.\\n10. Why does data visualization matter while analyzing data?\\nThe ability to clearly and concisely explain complicated data insights is one of the reasons data visualization is crucial. Thanks\\nto visual representations, stakeholders may more quickly comprehend trends, patterns, and correlations within the data,\\nwhich improves decision-making.\\n11. What is the importance of color in Data Visualisation?\\nIn data visualization, color is a potent tool. It can be applied to emphasize certain data points, show patterns and trends,\\nrepresent several categories or variables, or generate visual contrast. However, it‚Äôs crucial to utilize color carefully, keeping in\\nmind accessibility and preventing color blindness-related misunderstandings.\\n12. Which methods are most successful for producing compelling data\\nvisualizations?\\nThe use of appropriate titles and labels, context and concise explanations, effective use of color to highlight important\\ninformation, appropriate scaling, and making sure the visualization is aesthetically pleasing and simple to understand are\\nsome best practices for producing successful data visualizations.\\n13. What is Tableau, and how does it function while analyzing data?\\nData Analysts may generate dynamic and aesthetically pleasing dashboards, reports, and charts using the sophisticated data\\nvisualization and business intelligence platform Tableau. Users may do data blending and transformation, connect to a variety\\nof data sources, and create visualizations to produce insights.\\n14. In Tableau, how do you construct a calculated field?\\nIn Tableau, you can create a calculated field by right-clicking on the data pane, choosing ‚ÄúCreate Calculated Field,‚Äù and then\\nspecifying the calculation in the formula editor. You may calculate using pre-existing fields or unique formulas to gain fresh\\ninsights thanks to calculated fields.\\n15. What are the differences between Tableau‚Äôs dimensions and measures?\\nFor example, client names or product categories are categorical variables known as dimensions in Tableau. On the other\\nhand, measures are quantitative or numerical variables that reflect facts that may be combined, such as sales revenue or\\nprofit. Measures are often used for computations and aggregation, whereas dimensions are frequently used for grouping and\\ncategorization.\\n16. In Tableau, how do you make a dual-axis chart?\\nTo make a dual-axis chart, you may drag two measures onto the ‚ÄúColumns‚Äù or ‚ÄúRows‚Äù shelf. Select ‚ÄúDual Axis‚Äù from the menu\\nby performing a right-click on one of the measurements. This enables more meaningful visualizations by allowing you to\\ncompare two separate metrics on two different scales using common dimensions.\\n17. What does a Tableau parameter do, and how do you utilize it?\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nIn Tableau, a parameter is a user-defined input that enables interactive visualization, customization, and exploration. Users\\ncan dynamically change inputs or values to affect computations and filtering options. A list of values, a computed field, or a\\nrange of values can be used to generate parameters.\\n18. What exactly is a Tableau data extract?\\nA compressed, optimized subset of the data taken from the original data source is known as a Tableau data extract. It is kept\\nin Tableau‚Äôs exclusive format, which allows for quicker performance and effective data analysis. Data extracts are helpful\\nbecause they lessen the need for a live connection to the data source when dealing with big datasets or when offline access is\\nnecessary.\\n19. In Tableau, how do you make a dashboard?\\nIn Tableau, you can drag and drop spreadsheets, charts, and other items into the dashboard canvas to build a dashboard. After\\nthat, you may rearrange and resize these elements as well as add text, photos, filters, and interactive elements to provide a\\nunified and engaging display of the data. Multiple visualizations are aggregated into aesthetically pleasing dashboards.\\n20. In statistics, what distinguishes a population from a sample?\\nA whole collection of people, things, or events of interest are referred to as a population in statistics. You want to draw\\nconclusions about the entire group. On the other hand, a sample is a portion of the population. A smaller representative\\nsample of the population is used to make inferences or forecasts about the population as a whole.\\n21. The central limit theorem: what is it, and why is it significant?\\nThe central limit theorem predicts that as sample size rises, the sampling distribution of the sample means will resemble a\\nnormal distribution, independent of the form of the population distribution. This is significant because, under some\\ncircumstances, it enables us to draw conclusions about the population using sample data.\\n22. What distinguishes correlation from causation?\\nAn indication of how two variables fluctuate together statistically is referred to as correlation. It gauges the association‚Äôs\\nstrength and direction. On the other hand, causality indicates a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables,\\nshowing that changes in one variable directly affect changes in the other. Correlation does not prove causation because other\\nfactors or forces may be at play.\\n23, What does the p-value mean when testing a hypothesis?\\nThe likelihood of seeing a test statistic that is equally extreme or more extreme than the one derived from the sample data,\\ngiven the null hypothesis is correct, is known as the p-value. It aids in determining the results‚Äô statistical significance. The\\nresults are deemed statistically significant if the p-value is less than the preset significance threshold (for example, 0.05),\\nwhich shows evidence against the null hypothesis.\\n24. How do Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing differ from one\\nanother?\\nA Type I error in hypothesis testing happens in data science interview questions when the null hypothesis is disregarded even\\nif it is correct. It stands for a falsely positive finding. A Type II error, on the other hand, happens when the null hypothesis is\\naccepted despite being erroneous. It indicates a misleading negative outcome. As a result of the inverse relationship between\\nKind I and Type II errors, lowering one kind of error raises the probability of the other.\\n26. What distinguishes descriptive statistics from inferential statistics?\\nDescriptive statistics summarise and describe data using measurements like mean, median, standard deviation, and graphical\\nrepresentations. It strives to give a clear overview of the information. On the other hand, inferential statistics uses sample\\ndata to derive conclusions and inferences about the population as a whole. It employs methods like confidence intervals and\\nhypothesis testing.\\n27. Describe the machine learning notion of overfitting.\\nThis is known as overfitting when a machine learning model performs well on training data but poorly on new, untried data. It\\noccurs when a model grows overly complicated and begins to capture random fluctuations or noise in the training data rather\\nthan the underlying patterns. Techniques like regularization, cross-validation, or utilizing extra training data can all be used to\\nreduce overfitting.\\n28. What distinguishes supervised from unsupervised learning?\\nIn supervised learning, inputs are coupled with appropriate target labels, and the system is taught using labeled data. Based\\non the patterns discovered during training, the algorithm develops the ability to anticipate the labels of fresh, unused data.\\nThere are no goal labels in unsupervised learning. The program investigates the data without any specified outputs to\\ndiscover innate patterns, correlations, or clusters.\\n29. What do you understand by Cross-Validation?\\nA machine learning model‚Äôs performance and generalizability are assessed using the cross-validation approach. It entails\\ndividing the dataset into a number of subgroups or ‚Äúfolds.‚Äù A significant portion of the dataset is used to train the model, while\\nthe leftover is used to validation. This process has multiple iterations, with various subsets acting as the validation set. Cross-\\nvalidation aids in calculating the generalization error of the model and evaluating how well it performs on unknown data.\\n30. How can we use Excel in data analysis?\\nMicrosoft Excel is a popular spreadsheet program that enables users to arrange, examine, and work with data. Data entry,\\ncomputation, formatting, and visualization functions are available. Excel is used in data analysis to carry out operations such\\nas data cleansing, sorting, filtering, constructing formulae and functions, producing charts, and carrying out fundamental\\nstatistical analysis.\\n31. In Excel, how do you make a pivot table?\\nThe steps are as follow to construct a pivot table in Excel:\\nChoose the data set that you want to examine.\\nNavigate to the ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù tab and choose ‚ÄúPivotTable.‚Äù\\nChoose the pivot table‚Äôs range and placement in the dialogue box.\\nDrag and drag the pertinent fields to the values regions, rows, and columns.\\nMake necessary adjustments to the pivot table‚Äôs format, layout, and summary computations.\\n32. What does Excel conditional formatting mean?\\nThe function known as conditional formatting in Excel enables you to format cells in accordance with predefined criteria or\\nrules. It assists in graphically highlighting data that satisfy particular requirements. For instance, using conditional formatting,\\nyou may highlight duplicate cells, apply color scales based on cell values, or highlight cells with values over a specific\\nthreshold.\\n‚Üê Previous Post\\nNext Post ‚Üí\\nMust Read\\nAmazon Summer\\nInternship 2025 for Data\\nScientists ‚Äì An Effective\\nGuide\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 23, 2025\\nThe Summer Internship Program for\\nthe Year 2025 at Amazon: Your\\nGateway to a Data Scientist Career\\nAre you a‚Ä¶\\nData Labeling: What It Is,\\nHow It Works, and Why It\\nMatters in 2025\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 17, 2025\\nIn an age where the pot is really\\nboiling for all sorts of artificial\\nintelligence and machine-learning\\nterms, ‚Äúdata labeling‚Äù‚Ä¶\\nData Lake vs Data\\nWarehouse: Which One\\nShould You Choose in\\n2025?\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 16, 2025\\nToday, efficiency is crucial in\\nmanaging and storing data in the\\ndata-driven world; therefore, people\\nneed to learn how to‚Ä¶\\nData Science with Generative AI Course\\n‚Çπ20000\\nExplore\\nsupport@pwskills.com\\n\\uf0e0\\n+91 8448982581\\n\\uf879\\n\\uf08c\\n\\uf167\\n\\uf2c6\\nCompany\\nAbout us\\nFAQ\\nPrivacy policy\\nContact us\\nJob assistance\\nTerms and condition\\nProducts\\nPW Skills Lab\\nExperience Portal\\nHall Of fame\\nJob Portal\\nBecome an affiliate\\nBlog\\n'}, {'Bsc Data Science Syllabus Enrollment Future And Scope.pdf': 'Home ¬ª Data Science ¬ª Bsc Data Science Syllabus Enrollment Future and Scope\\nData Science\\nBsc Data Science Syllabus Enrollment Future and Scope\\nIn our modern-day Bsc Data Science rapid-paced surroundings, facts technology has proven to be a sport-changer; Data\\ntechnology has evolved into a hard vocation across sectors due to its ability to extract insights, expect tendencies, and\\nimpact decision-making.\\nWith its many uses and employment potentialities, information technological know-how has a shiny destiny.

This is because rule-\\nbased machine learning applies some form of learning algorithm such as Rough sets theory[7] to identify and minimise the set of features and to automatically identify useful rules, rather than a human needing to apply\\nprior domain knowledge to manually construct rules and curate a rule set.\\nRules typically take the form of an \\'{IF:THEN} expression\\', (e.g. {IF \\'condition\\' THEN \\'result\\'}, or as a more specific example, {IF \\'red\\' AND \\'octagon\\' THEN \\'stop-sign}). An individual rule is not in itself a model, since the rule\\nis only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Therefore rule-based machine learning methods typically comprise a set of rules, or knowledge base, that collectively make up the prediction model usually known as\\ndecision algorithm. Rules can also be interpreted in various ways depending on the domain knowledge, data types(discrete or continuous) and in combinations.\\nRepeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction (RIPPER) is a propositional rule learner proposed by William W.

It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some\\nmeasures of interestingness.[1] In any given transaction with a variety of items, association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected.\\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli≈Ñski and Arun Swami[2] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-\\nof-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule \\n found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are\\nlikely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.\\nIn addition to the above example from market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and\\nbioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\\nThe association rule algorithm itself consists of various parameters that can make it difficult for those without some expertise in data mining to execute, with many rules that are arduous to understand.[3]\\nA Venn Diagram to show the associations\\nbetween itemsets X and Y of a dataset. All\\ntransactions that contain item X are located\\nin the white, left portion of the circle, while\\nthose containing Y are colored red and on\\nthe right. Any transaction containing both X\\nand Y are located in the middle and are\\ncolored pink. Multiple concepts can be used\\nto depict information from this graph. For\\nexample, if one takes all of the transactions\\nin the pink section and divided them by the\\ntotal amount of transactions (transactions\\ncontaining X (white) + transactions\\ncontaining Y(red)), the output would be\\nknown as the support. An instance of\\ngetting the result of a method known as the\\nconfidence, one can take all of the\\ntransactions in the middle (pink) and divide\\nthem by all transactions that contain Y (red\\nand pink). In this case, Y is the antecedent\\nand X is the consequent.\\nFollowing the original definition by Agrawal, Imieli≈Ñski, Swami[2] the problem of association rule mining is defined as:\\nLet \\n be a set of n binary attributes called items.\\nLet \\n be a set of transactions called the database.\\nEach transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I.\\nA rule is defined as an implication of the form:\\n, where \\n.\\nIn Agrawal, Imieli≈Ñski, Swami[2] a rule is defined only between a set and a single item, \\n for \\n.\\nEvery rule is composed by two different sets of items, also known as itemsets, X and Y, where X is called antecedent or left-hand-side (LHS) and Y consequent or right-hand-side (RHS). The antecedent is that item that\\ncan be found in the data while the consequent is the item found when combined with the antecedent. The statement \\n is often read as if X then Y, where the antecedent (X ) is the if and the consequent (Y) is the\\nthen. This simply implies that, in theory, whenever X occurs in a dataset, then Y will as well.\\nAssociation rules are made by searching data for frequent if-then patterns and by using a certain criterion under Support and Confidence to define what the most important relationships are. Support is the evidence of\\nhow frequent an item appears in the data given, as Confidence is defined by how many times the if-then statements are found true. However, there is a third criteria that can be used, it is called Lift and it can be used to\\ncompare the expected Confidence and the actual Confidence. Lift will show how many times the if-then statement is expected to be found to be true.\\nAssociation rules are made to calculate from itemsets, which are created by two or more items. If the rules were built from the analyzing from all the possible itemsets from the data then there would be so many rules\\nthat they wouldn‚Äôt have any meaning. That is why Association rules are typically made from rules that are well represented by the data.\\nThere are many different data mining techniques you could use to find certain analytics and results, for example, there is Classification analysis, Clustering analysis, and Regression analysis.[4] What technique you\\nshould use depends on what you are looking for with your data. Association rules are primarily used to find analytics and a prediction of customer behavior. For Classification analysis, it would most likely be used to\\nquestion, make decisions, and predict behavior.[5] Clustering analysis is primarily used when there are no assumptions made about the likely relationships within the data.[5] Regression analysis Is used when you want to\\npredict the value of a continuous dependent from a number of independent variables.[5]\\nBenefits\\nThere are many benefits of using Association rules like finding the pattern that helps understand the correlations and co-occurrences between data sets. A very good real-world example that uses Association rules\\nwould be medicine. Medicine uses Association rules to help diagnose patients. When diagnosing patients there are many variables to consider as many diseases will share similar symptoms. With the use of the\\nAssociation rules, doctors can determine the conditional probability of an illness by comparing symptom relationships from past cases.[6]\\nDownsides\\nHowever, Association rules also lead to many different downsides such as finding the appropriate parameter and threshold settings for the mining algorithm. But there is also the downside of having a large number of\\ndiscovered rules. The reason is that this does not guarantee that the rules will be found relevant, but it could also cause the algorithm to have low performance. Sometimes the implemented algorithms will contain too\\nmany variables and parameters. For someone that doesn‚Äôt have a good concept of data mining, this might cause them to have trouble understanding it.[7]\\nThresholds\\nDefinition\\nProcess\\nTable 2.

Note that\\nlower levels of the lattice can contain at\\nmost the minimum number of their parents\\'\\nitems; e.g. {ac} can have only at most\\n items. This is called the\\ndownward-closure property.[2]\\nWhen using Association rules, you are most likely to only use Support and Confidence. However, this means you have to satisfy a user-specified minimum support and a user-specified minimum confidence at the same\\ntime. Usually, the Association rule generation is split into two different steps that needs to be applied:\\n1. A minimum Support threshold to find all the frequent itemsets that are in the database.\\n2. A minimum Confidence threshold to the frequent itemsets found to create rules.\\nTable 1. Example of Threshold for Support and\\nConfidence.\\nItems Support Confidence\\nItems Support Confidence\\nItem A 30%\\n50%\\nItem C 45%\\n55%\\nItem B 15%\\n25%\\nItem A 30%\\n50%\\nItem C 45%\\n55%\\nItem D 35%\\n40%\\nItem D 35%\\n40%\\nItem B 15%\\n25%\\nThe Support Threshold is 30%, Confidence Threshold is 50%\\nThe Table on the left is the original unorganized data and the table on the right is organized by the thresholds. In this case Item C is better than the thresholds for both Support and Confidence which is why it is first.\\nItem A is second because its threshold values are spot on. Item D has met the threshold for Support but not Confidence. Item B has not met the threshold for either Support or Confidence and that is why it is last.\\nTo find all the frequent itemsets in a database is not an easy task since it involves going through all the data to find all possible item combinations from all possible itemsets. The set of possible itemsets is the power\\nset over I and has size \\n , of course this means to exclude the empty set which is not considered to be a valid itemset. However, the size of the power set will grow exponentially in the number of item n that is\\nwithin the power set I. An efficient search is possible by using the downward-closure property of support[2][8] (also called anti-monotonicity[9]). This would guarantee that a frequent itemset and all its subsets are also\\nfrequent and thus will have no infrequent itemsets as a subset of a frequent itemset. Exploiting this property, efficient algorithms (e.g., Apriori[10] and Eclat[11]) can find all frequent itemsets.\\nTo illustrate the concepts, we use a small example from the supermarket domain. Table 2 shows a small database containing the items where, in each entry, the\\nvalue 1 means the presence of the item in the corresponding transaction, and the value 0 represents the absence of an item in that transaction. The set of items is\\n.\\nAn example rule for the supermarket could be \\n meaning that if butter and bread are bought, customers also buy milk.\\nIn order to select interesting rules from the set of all possible rules, constraints on various measures of significance and interest are used. The best-known\\nconstraints are minimum thresholds on support and confidence.\\nLet \\n be itemsets, \\n an association rule and T a set of transactions of a given database.\\nNote: this example is extremely small. In practical applications, a rule needs a support of several hundred transactions before it can be considered statistically\\nsignificant, and datasets often contain thousands or millions of transactions.\\nSupport\\nSupport is an indication of how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset.\\nIn our example, it can be easier to explain support by writing \\n[12] where A and B are separate item sets that occur at the same time in\\na transaction.\\nUsing Table 2 as an example, the itemset \\n has a support of 1/5=0.2 since it occurs in 20% of all transactions (1 out of 5 transactions). The argument of support of X is a set of preconditions, and\\nthus becomes more restrictive as it grows (instead of more inclusive).[13]\\nFurthermore, the itemset \\n has a support of 1/5=0.2 as it appears in 20% of all transactions as well.\\nWhen using antecedents and consequents, it allows a data miner to determine the support of multiple items being bought together in comparison to the whole data set. For example, Table 2 shows that if milk is bought,\\nthen bread is bought has a support of 0.4 or 40%. This because in 2 out 5 of the transactions, milk as well as bread are bought. In smaller data sets like this example, it is harder to see a strong correlation when there are\\nfew samples, but when the data set grows larger, support can be used to find correlation between two or more products in the supermarket example.\\nMinimum support thresholds are useful for determining which itemsets are preferred or interesting.\\nIf we set the support threshold to ‚â•0.4 in Table 3, then the \\n would be removed since it did not meet the minimum threshold of 0.4. Minimum threshold is used to remove samples where there is not a\\nstrong enough support or confidence to deem the sample as important or interesting in the dataset.\\nAnother way of finding interesting samples is to find the value of (support)√ó(confidence); this allows a data miner to see the samples where support and confidence are high enough to be highlighted in the dataset and\\nprompt a closer look at the sample to find more information on the connection between the items.\\nSupport can be beneficial for finding the connection between products in comparison to the whole dataset, whereas confidence looks at the connection between one or more items and another item. Below is a table\\nthat shows the comparison and contrast between support and support √ó confidence, using the information from Table 4 to derive the confidence values.\\nUseful Concepts\\nTable 3. Example of Support, and support √ó confidence\\nif Antecedent then Consequent\\nsupport\\nsupport X confidence\\nif buy milk, then buy bread\\n2/5= 0.4\\n0.4√ó1.0= 0.4\\nif buy milk, then buy eggs\\n1/5= 0.2\\n0.2√ó0.5= 0.1\\nif buy bread, then buy fruit\\n2/5= 0.4\\n0.4√ó0.66= 0.264\\nif buy fruit, then buy eggs\\n2/5= 0.4\\n0.4√ó0.66= 0.264\\nif buy milk and bread, then buy fruit 2/5= 0.4\\n0.4√ó1.0= 0.4\\nThe support of X with respect to T is defined as the proportion of transactions in the dataset which contains the itemset X. Denoting a transaction by \\n where i is the unique identifier of the transaction and t is its\\nitemset, the support may be written as:\\nThis notation can be used when defining more complicated datasets where the items and itemsets may not be as easy as our supermarket example above. Other examples of where support can be used is in finding\\ngroups of genetic mutations that work collectively to cause a disease, investigating the number of subscribers that respond to upgrade offers, and discovering which products in a drug store are never bought\\ntogether.[12]\\nConfidence\\nConfidence is the percentage of all transactions satisfying X that also satisfy Y.[14]\\nWith respect to T, the confidence value of an association rule, often denoted as \\n, is the ratio of transactions containing both X and Y to the total amount of X values present, where X is the antecedent and Y is\\nthe consequent.\\nConfidence can also be interpreted as an estimate of the conditional probability\\n, the probability of finding the RHS of the rule in transactions under the condition that these transactions also contain the\\nLHS.[13][15]\\nIt is commonly depicted as:\\nThe equation illustrates that confidence can be computed by calculating the co-occurrence of transactions X and Y within the dataset in ratio to transactions containing only X. This means that the number of\\ntransactions in both X and Y is divided by those just in X .\\nFor example, Table 2 shows the rule \\n which has a confidence of \\n in the dataset, which denotes that every time a customer buys butter and bread, they also buy milk.\\nThis particular example demonstrates the rule being correct 100% of the time for transactions containing both butter and bread. The rule \\n, however, has a confidence of \\n. This\\nsuggests that eggs are bought 67% of the times that fruit is brought. Within this particular dataset, fruit is purchased a total of 3 times, with two of those times consisting of egg purchases.\\nFor larger datasets, a minimum threshold, or a percentage cutoff, for the confidence can be useful for determining item relationships. When applying this method to some of the data in Table 2, information that does not\\nmeet the requirements are removed. Table 4 shows association rule examples where the minimum threshold for confidence is 0.5 (50%). Any data that does not have a confidence of at least 0.5 is omitted. Generating\\nthresholds allow for the association between items to become stronger as the data is further researched by emphasizing those that co-occur the most. The table uses the confidence information from Table 3 to\\nimplement the Support √ó Confidence column, where the relationship between items via their both confidence and support, instead of just one concept, is highlighted. Ranking the rules by Support √ó Confidence multiples\\nthe confidence of a particular rule to its support and is often implemented for a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between the items.\\nTable 4. Example of Confidence and Support √ó Confidence\\nif Antecedent then Consequent\\nConfidence\\nSupport √ó Confidence\\nif buy milk, then buy bread\\n2‚ÅÑ2 = 1.0\\n0.4√ó1.0= 0.4\\nif buy milk, then buy eggs\\n1‚ÅÑ2 = 0.5\\n0.2√ó0.5= 0.1\\nif buy bread, then buy fruit\\n2‚ÅÑ3 ‚âà 0.66\\n0.4√ó0.66= 0.264\\nif buy fruit, then buy eggs\\n2‚ÅÑ3 ‚âà 0.66\\n0.4√ó0.66= 0.264\\nif buy milk and bread, then buy fruit 2‚ÅÑ2 = 1.0\\n0.4√ó1.0= 0.4\\nOverall, using confidence in association rule mining is great way to bring awareness to data relations. Its greatest benefit is highlighting the relationship between particular items to one another within the set, as it\\ncompares co-occurrences of items to the total occurrence of the antecedent in the specific rule. However, confidence is not the optimal method for every concept in association rule mining. The disadvantage of using it\\nis that it does not offer multiple difference outlooks on the associations. Unlike support, for instance, confidence does not provide the perspective of relationships between certain items in comparison to the entire\\ndataset, so while milk and bread, for example, may occur 100% of the time for confidence, it only has a support of 0.4 (40%). This is why it is important to look at other viewpoints, such as Support √ó Confidence, instead\\nof solely relying on one concept incessantly to define the relationships.\\nLift\\nThe lift of a rule is defined as:\\nor the ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent.\\nFor example, the rule \\n has a lift of \\n.\\nIf the rule had a lift of 1, it would imply that the probability of occurrence of the antecedent and that of the consequent are independent of each other. When two events are independent of each other, no rule can be\\ndrawn involving those two events.\\nIf the lift is > 1, that lets us know the degree to which those two occurrences are dependent on one another, and makes those rules potentially useful for predicting the consequent in future data sets.\\nIf the lift is < 1, that lets us know the items are substitute to each other. This means that presence of one item has negative effect on presence of other item and vice versa.\\nThe value of lift is that it considers both the support of the rule and the overall data set.[13]\\n[rede]\\nConviction\\nThe conviction of a rule is defined as \\n.[16]\\nFor example, the rule \\n has a conviction of \\n, and can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule\\nmakes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. In this example, the conviction value of 1.2 shows that the rule \\nwould be incorrect 20% more often (1.2 times as often) if the association between X and Y was purely random chance.\\nAlternative measures of interestingness\\nIn addition to confidence, other measures of interestingness for rules have been proposed. Some popular measures are:\\nAll-confidence[17]\\nCollective strength[18]\\nLeverage[19]\\nSeveral more measures are presented and compared by Tan et al.[20] and by Hahsler.[21] Looking for techniques that can model what the user has known (and using these models as interestingness measures) is\\ncurrently an active research trend under the name of \"Subjective Interestingness.\"\\nThe concept of association rules was popularized particularly due to the 1993 article of Agrawal et al.,[2] which has acquired more than 23,790 citations according to Google Scholar, as of April 2021, and is thus one of\\nthe most cited papers in the Data Mining field. However, what is now called \"association rules\" is introduced already in the 1966 paper[22] on GUHA, a general data mining method developed by Petr H√°jek et al.[23]\\nAn early (circa 1989) use of minimum support and confidence to find all association rules is the Feature Based Modeling framework, which found all rules with \\n and \\n greater than user defined\\nconstraints.[24]\\nOne limitation of the standard approach to discovering associations is that by searching massive numbers of possible associations to look for collections of items that appear to be associated, there is a large risk of\\nfinding many spurious associations. These are collections of items that co-occur with unexpected frequency in the data, but only do so by chance. For example, suppose we are considering a collection of 10,000 items\\nand looking for rules containing two items in the left-hand-side and 1 item in the right-hand-side. There are approximately 1,000,000,000,000 such rules. If we apply a statistical test for independence with a significance\\nlevel of 0.05 it means there is only a 5% chance of accepting a rule if there is no association. If we assume there are no associations, we should nonetheless expect to find 50,000,000,000 rules. Statistically sound\\nassociation discovery[25][26] controls this risk, in most cases reducing the risk of finding any spurious associations to a user-specified significance level.\\nMany algorithms for generating association rules have been proposed.\\nSome well-known algorithms are Apriori, Eclat and FP-Growth, but they only do half the job, since they are algorithms for mining frequent itemsets. Another step needs to be done after to generate rules from frequent\\nitemsets found in a database.\\nApriori algorithm\\nApriori is given by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994 for frequent item set mining and association rule learning. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and\\nlarger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often. The name of the algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties.\\nThe control flow diagram for the Apriori algorithm\\nOverview: Apriori uses a \"bottom up\" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm\\nterminates when no further successful extensions are found. Apriori uses breadth-first search and a Hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates candidate item sets of length \\xa0from item sets\\nof length . Then it prunes the candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent -length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction\\ndatabase to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.\\nExample: Assume that each row is a cancer sample with a certain combination of mutations labeled by a character in the alphabet. For example a row could have {a, c} which means it is affected by mutation \\'a\\' and\\nmutation \\'c\\'.\\nInput Set\\n{a, b} {c, d} {a, d} {a, e} {b, d} {a, b, d} {a, c, d} {a, b, c, d}\\nNow we will generate the frequent item set by counting the number of occurrences of each character. This is also known as finding the support values. Then we will prune the item set by picking a minimum support\\nthreshold. For this pass of the algorithm we will pick 3.\\nSupport\\nValues\\na b c d\\n6 4 3 6\\nHistory\\nStatistically sound associations\\nAlgorithms\\nSince all support values are three or above there is no pruning. The frequent item set is {a}, {b}, {c}, and {d}. After this we will repeat the process by counting pairs of mutations in the input set.\\nSupport Values\\n{a, b} {a, c} {a, d} {b, c} {b, d} {c, d}\\n3\\n2\\n4\\n1\\n3\\n3\\nNow we will make our minimum support value 4 so only {a, d} will remain after pruning. Now we will use the frequent item set to make combinations of triplets. We will then repeat the process by counting occurrences\\nof triplets of mutations in the input set.\\nSupport\\nValues\\n{a, c, d}\\n2\\nSince we only have one item the next set of combinations of quadruplets is empty so the algorithm will stop.\\nAdvantages and Limitations:\\nApriori has some limitations. Candidate generation can result in large candidate sets. For example a 10^4 frequent 1-itemset will generate a 10^7 candidate 2-itemset. The algorithm also needs to frequently scan the\\ndatabase, to be specific n+1 scans where n is the length of the longest pattern. Apriori is slower than the Eclat algorithm. However, Apriori performs well compared to Eclat when the dataset is large. This is because in\\nthe Eclat algorithm if the dataset is too large the tid-lists become too large for memory. FP-growth outperforms the Apriori and Eclat. This is due to the FP-growth algorithm not having candidate generation or test, using\\na compact data structure, and only having one database scan.[27]\\nEclat algorithm\\nEclat[11] (alt. ECLAT, stands for Equivalence Class Transformation) is a backtracking algorithm, which traverses the frequent itemset lattice graph in a depth-first search (DFS) fashion. Whereas the breadth-first search\\n(BFS) traversal used in the Apriori algorithm will end up checking every subset of an itemset before checking it, DFS traversal checks larger itemsets and can save on checking the support of some of its subsets by\\nvirtue of the downward-closer property. Furthermore it will almost certainly use less memory as DFS has a lower space complexity than BFS.\\nTo illustrate this, let there be a frequent itemset {a, b, c}. a DFS may check the nodes in the frequent itemset lattice in the following order: {a} ‚Üí {a, b} ‚Üí {a, b, c}, at which point it is known that {b}, {c}, {a, c}, {b, c} all\\nsatisfy the support constraint by the downward-closure property. BFS would explore each subset of {a, b, c} before finally checking it. As the size of an itemset increases, the number of its subsets undergoes\\ncombinatorial explosion.\\nIt is suitable for both sequential as well as parallel execution with locality-enhancing properties.[28][29]\\nFP-growth algorithm\\nFP stands for frequent pattern.[30]\\nIn the first pass, the algorithm counts the occurrences of items (attribute-value pairs) in the dataset of transactions, and stores these counts in a \\'header table\\'. In the second pass, it builds the FP-tree structure by\\ninserting transactions into a trie.\\nItems in each transaction have to be sorted by descending order of their frequency in the dataset before being inserted so that the tree can be processed quickly. Items in each transaction that do not meet the minimum\\nsupport requirement are discarded. If many transactions share most frequent items, the FP-tree provides high compression close to tree root.\\nRecursive processing of this compressed version of the main dataset grows frequent item sets directly, instead of generating candidate items and testing them against the entire database (as in the apriori algorithm).\\nGrowth begins from the bottom of the header table i.e. the item with the smallest support by finding all sorted transactions that end in that item. Call this item .\\nA new conditional tree is created which is the original FP-tree projected onto . The supports of all nodes in the projected tree are re-counted with each node getting the sum of its children counts. Nodes (and hence\\nsubtrees) that do not meet the minimum support are pruned. Recursive growth ends when no individual items conditional on  meet the minimum support threshold. The resulting paths from root to  will be frequent\\nitemsets. After this step, processing continues with the next least-supported header item of the original FP-tree.\\nOnce the recursive process has completed, all frequent item sets will have been found, and association rule creation begins.[31]\\nOthers\\nASSOC\\nThe ASSOC procedure[32] is a GUHA method which mines for generalized association rules using fast bitstrings operations. The association rules mined by this method are more general than those output by apriori, for\\nexample \"items\" can be connected both with conjunction and disjunctions and the relation between antecedent and consequent of the rule is not restricted to setting minimum support and confidence as in apriori: an\\narbitrary combination of supported interest measures can be used.\\nOPUS search\\nOPUS is an efficient algorithm for rule discovery that, in contrast to most alternatives, does not require either monotone or anti-monotone constraints such as minimum support.[33] Initially used to find rules for a fixed\\nconsequent[33][34] it has subsequently been extended to find rules with any item as a consequent.[35] OPUS search is the core technology in the popular Magnum Opus association discovery system.\\nA famous story about association rule mining is the \"beer and diaper\" story. A purported survey of behavior of supermarket shoppers discovered that customers (presumably young men) who buy diapers tend also to\\nbuy beer. This anecdote became popular as an example of how unexpected association rules might be found from everyday data. There are varying opinions as to how much of the story is true.[36] Daniel Powers\\nsays:[36]\\nIn 1992, Thomas Blischok, manager of a retail consulting group at Teradata, and his staff prepared an analysis of 1.2 million market baskets from about 25 Osco Drug stores. Database\\nqueries were developed to identify affinities. The analysis \"did discover that between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. that consumers bought beer and diapers\". Osco managers did NOT exploit the\\nbeer and diapers relationship by moving the products closer together on the shelves.\\nLore\\nMulti-Relation Association Rules (MRAR): These are association rules where each item may have several relations. These relations indicate indirect relationships between the entities. Consider the following MRAR\\nwhere the first item consists of three relations live in, nearby and humid: ‚ÄúThose who live in a place which is nearby a city with humid climate type and also are younger than 20 \\n their health condition is good‚Äù. Such\\nassociation rules can be extracted from RDBMS data or semantic web data.[37]\\nContrast set learning is a form of associative learning. Contrast set learners use rules that differ meaningfully in their distribution across subsets.[38][39]\\nWeighted class learning is another form of associative learning where weights may be assigned to classes to give focus to a particular issue of concern for the consumer of the data mining results.\\nHigh-order pattern discovery facilitates the capture of high-order (polythetic) patterns or event associations that are intrinsic to complex real-world data. [40]\\nK-optimal pattern discovery provides an alternative to the standard approach to association rule learning which requires that each pattern appear frequently in the data.\\nApproximate Frequent Itemset mining is a relaxed version of Frequent Itemset mining that allows some of the items in some of the rows to be 0.[41]\\nGeneralized Association Rules hierarchical taxonomy (concept hierarchy)\\nQuantitative Association Rules categorical and quantitative data\\nInterval Data Association Rules e.g. partition the age into 5-year-increment ranged\\nSequential pattern mining discovers subsequences that are common to more than minsup (minimum support threshold) sequences in a sequence database, where minsup is set by the user. A sequence is an ordered\\nlist of transactions.[42]\\nSubspace Clustering, a specific type of clustering high-dimensional data, is in many variants also based on the downward-closure property for specific clustering models.[43]\\nWarmr, shipped as part of the ACE data mining suite, allows association rule learning for first order relational rules.[44]\\nSequence mining\\nProduction system (computer science)\\nLearning classifier system\\nRule-based machine learning\\n1.

Hahsler\\n'}, {'Apriori algorithm - Wikipedia.pdf': 'Apriori algorithm\\nApriori[1] is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and\\nlarger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the\\ndatabase: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.\\nThe Apriori algorithm was proposed by Agrawal and Srikant in 1994. Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions (for example, collections of items bought by customers, or details of a website\\nfrequentation or IP addresses[2]). Other algorithms are designed for finding association rules in data having no transactions (Winepi and Minepi), or having no timestamps (DNA sequencing). Each transaction is seen as\\na set of items (an itemset). Given a threshold \\n, the Apriori algorithm identifies the item sets which are subsets of at least \\n transactions in the database.\\nApriori uses a \"bottom up\" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates\\nwhen no further successful extensions are found.\\nApriori uses breadth-first search and a Hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates candidate item sets of length  from item sets of length \\n. Then it prunes the candidates which have\\nan infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent -length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the\\ncandidates.\\nThe pseudo code for the algorithm is given below for a transaction database \\n, and a support threshold of . Usual set theoretic notation is employed, though note that \\n is a multiset. \\n is the candidate set for level \\n. At each step, the algorithm is assumed to generate the candidate sets from the large item sets of the preceding level, heeding the downward closure lemma. \\n accesses a field of the data structure that\\nrepresents candidate set , which is initially assumed to be zero. Many details are omitted below, usually the most important part of the implementation is the data structure used for storing the candidate sets, and\\ncounting their frequencies.\\nApriori(T, Œµ)\\n    L1 ‚Üê {large singleton itemsets}\\n    k ‚Üê 2\\n    while Lk‚àí1 is not empty\\n        Ck ‚Üê Generate_candidates(Lk‚àí1, k)\\n        for transactions t in T\\n            Dt ‚Üê {c in Ck\\xa0: c ‚äÜ t}\\n            for candidates c in Dt\\n                count[c] ‚Üê count[c] + 1\\n        Lk ‚Üê {c in Ck\\xa0: count[c] ‚â• Œµ}\\n        k ‚Üê k + 1\\n    return Union(Lk) over all k\\n    \\nGenerate_candidates(L, k)\\n    result ‚Üê empty_set()\\n    for all p ‚àà L, q ‚àà L where p and q differ in exactly one element\\n        c ‚Üê p ‚à™ q\\n        if u ‚àà L for all u ‚äÜ c where |u| = k-1\\n            result.add(c)\\n    return result\\nExample 1\\nConsider the following database, where each row is a transaction and each cell is an individual item of the transaction:\\nŒ± Œ≤ Œµ\\nŒ± Œ≤ Œ∏\\nŒ± Œ≤ Œµ\\nŒ± Œ≤ Œ∏\\nThe association rules that can be determined from this database are the following:\\n1. 100% of sets with Œ± also contain Œ≤\\n2. 50% of sets with Œ±, Œ≤ also have Œµ\\n3. 50% of sets with Œ±, Œ≤ also have Œ∏\\nwe can also illustrate this through a variety of examples.\\nExample 2\\nAssume that a large supermarket tracks sales data by stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each item: each item, such as \"butter\" or \"bread\", is identified by a numerical SKU. The supermarket has a database of transactions\\nwhere each transaction is a set of SKUs that were bought together.\\nLet the database of transactions consist of following itemsets:\\nOverview\\nExamples\\nItemsets\\n{1,2,3,4}\\n{1,2,4}\\n{1,2}\\n{2,3,4}\\n{2,3}\\n{3,4}\\n{2,4}\\nWe will use Apriori to determine the frequent item sets of this database. To do this, we will say that an item set is frequent if it appears in at least 3 transactions of the database: the value 3 is the support threshold.\\nThe first step of Apriori is to count up the number of occurrences, called the support, of each member item separately. By scanning the database for the first time, we obtain the following result\\nItem Support\\n{1}\\n3\\n{2}\\n6\\n{3}\\n4\\n{4}\\n5\\nAll the itemsets of size 1 have a support of at least 3, so they are all frequent.\\nThe next step is to generate a list of all pairs of the frequent items.\\nFor example, regarding the pair {1,2}: the first table of Example 2 shows items 1 and 2 appearing together in three of the itemsets; therefore, we say item {1,2} has support of three.\\nItem Support\\n{1,2} 3\\n{1,3} 1\\n{1,4} 2\\n{2,3} 3\\n{2,4} 4\\n{3,4} 3\\nThe pairs {1,2}, {2,3}, {2,4}, and {3,4} all meet or exceed the minimum support of 3, so they are frequent. The pairs {1,3} and {1,4} are not. Now, because {1,3} and {1,4} are not frequent, any larger set which contains {1,3}\\nor {1,4} cannot be frequent. In this way, we can prune sets: we will now look for frequent triples in the database, but we can already exclude all the triples that contain one of these two pairs:\\nItem\\nSupport\\n{2,3,4} 2\\nin the example, there are no frequent triplets. {2,3,4} is below the minimal threshold, and the other triplets were excluded because they were super sets of pairs that were already below the threshold.\\nWe have thus determined the frequent sets of items in the database, and illustrated how some items were not counted because one of their subsets was already known to be below the threshold.\\nApriori, while historically significant, suffers from a number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned other algorithms. Candidate generation generates large numbers of subsets (The algorithm attempts to\\nload up the candidate set, with as many as possible subsets before each scan of the database). Bottom-up subset exploration (essentially a breadth-first traversal of the subset lattice) finds any maximal subset S only\\nafter all \\n of its proper subsets.\\nThe algorithm scans the database too many times, which reduces the overall performance. Due to this, the algorithm assumes that the database is permanently in the memory.\\nAlso, both the time and space complexity of this algorithm are very high: \\n, thus exponential, where \\n is the horizontal width (the total number of items) present in the database.\\nLater algorithms such as Max-Miner[3] try to identify the maximal frequent item sets without enumerating their subsets, and perform \"jumps\" in the search space rather than a purely bottom-up approach.\\n1.

Sequential pattern mining is a special case of structured data mining.\\nThere are several key traditional computational problems addressed within this field. These include building efficient databases and indexes for sequence information, extracting the frequently occurring patterns,\\ncomparing sequences for similarity, and recovering missing sequence members. In general, sequence mining problems can be classified as string mining which is typically based on string processing algorithms and\\nitemset mining which is typically based on association rule learning. Local process models [3] extend sequential pattern mining to more complex patterns that can include (exclusive) choices, loops, and concurrency\\nconstructs in addition to the sequential ordering construct.\\nString mining typically deals with a limited alphabet for items that appear in a sequence, but the sequence itself may be typically very long. Examples of an alphabet can be those in the ASCII character set used in\\nnatural language text, nucleotide bases \\'A\\', \\'G\\', \\'C\\' and \\'T\\' in DNA sequences, or amino acids for protein sequences. In biology applications analysis of the arrangement of the alphabet in strings can be used to examine\\ngene and protein sequences to determine their properties. Knowing the sequence of letters of a DNA or a protein is not an ultimate goal in itself. Rather, the major task is to understand the sequence, in terms of its\\nstructure and biological function. This is typically achieved first by identifying individual regions or structural units within each sequence and then assigning a function to each structural unit. In many cases this requires\\ncomparing a given sequence with previously studied ones. The comparison between the strings becomes complicated when insertions, deletions and mutations occur in a string.\\nA survey and taxonomy of the key algorithms for sequence comparison for bioinformatics is presented by Abouelhoda & Ghanem (2010), which include:[4]\\nRepeat-related problems: that deal with operations on single sequences and can be based on exact string matching or approximate string matching methods for finding dispersed fixed length and maximal length\\nrepeats, finding tandem repeats, and finding unique subsequences and missing (un-spelled) subsequences.\\nAlignment problems: that deal with comparison between strings by first aligning one or more sequences; examples of popular methods include BLAST for comparing a single sequence with multiple sequences in a\\ndatabase, and ClustalW for multiple alignments. Alignment algorithms can be based on either exact or approximate methods, and can also be classified as global alignments, semi-global alignments and local\\nalignment. See sequence alignment.\\nSome problems in sequence mining lend themselves to discovering frequent itemsets and the order they appear, for example, one is seeking rules of the form \"if a {customer buys a car}, he or she is likely to {buy\\ninsurance} within 1 week\", or in the context of stock prices, \"if {Nokia up and Ericsson up}, it is likely that {Motorola up and Samsung up} within 2 days\". Traditionally, itemset mining is used in marketing applications for\\ndiscovering regularities between frequently co-occurring items in large transactions. For example, by analysing transactions of customer shopping baskets in a supermarket, one can produce a rule which reads \"if a\\ncustomer buys onions and potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy hamburger meat in the same transaction\".\\nA survey and taxonomy of the key algorithms for item set mining is presented by Han et al. (2007).[5]\\nThe two common techniques that are applied to sequence databases for frequent itemset mining are the influential apriori algorithm and the more-recent FP-growth technique.\\nWith a great variation of products and user buying behaviors, shelf on which products are being displayed is one of the most important resources in retail environment. Retailers can not only increase their profit but, also\\ndecrease cost by proper management of shelf space allocation and products display. To solve this problem, George and Binu (2013) have proposed an approach to mine user buying patterns using PrefixSpan algorithm\\nand place the products on shelves based on the order of mined purchasing patterns.[6]\\nCommonly used algorithms include:\\nGSP algorithm\\nSequential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence classes (SPADE)\\nFreeSpan\\nPrefixSpan\\nMAPres[7]\\nSeq2Pat (for constraint-based sequential pattern mining)[8][9]\\nCollocation extraction\\xa0‚Äì Computational technique to find word sequences\\nProcess mining\\xa0‚Äì Data mining technique using event logs\\nSequence analysis\\xa0‚Äì Identification and study of genomic sequences\\nSequence analysis in social sciences\\xa0‚Äì Analysis of sets of categorical sequences\\nSequence clustering\\nSequence labeling\\n1.

The algorithms for solving sequence mining problems are mostly based on the apriori (level-wise) algorithm. One\\nway to use the level-wise paradigm is to first discover all the frequent items in a level-wise fashion. It simply means counting the occurrences of all singleton elements in the database. Then, the transactions are filtered\\nby removing the non-frequent items. At the end of this step, each transaction consists of only the frequent elements it originally contained. This modified database becomes an input to the GSP algorithm. This process\\nrequires one pass over the whole database.\\nGSP algorithm makes multiple database passes. In the first pass, all single items (1-sequences) are counted. From the frequent items, a set of candidate 2-sequences are formed, and another pass is made to identify\\ntheir frequency. The frequent 2-sequences are used to generate the candidate 3-sequences, and this process is repeated until no more frequent sequences are found. There are two main steps in the algorithm.\\nCandidate Generation. Given the set of frequent (k-1)-frequent sequences Fk-1, the candidates for the next pass are generated by joining F(k-1) with itself. A pruning phase eliminates any sequence, at least one of\\nwhose subsequences is not frequent.\\nSupport Counting. Normally, a hash tree‚Äìbased search is employed for efficient support counting. Finally non-maximal frequent sequences are removed.\\n   F1 = the set of frequent 1-sequence\\n   k=2,\\n   do while Fk-1\\xa0!= Null;\\n       Generate candidate sets Ck (set of candidate k-sequences);\\n       For all input sequences s in the database D\\n       do\\n           Increment count of all a in Ck if s supports a\\n       End do\\n       Fk = {a ‚àà Ck such that its frequency exceeds the threshold}\\n       k = k+1;\\n   End do\\n   Result = Set of all frequent sequences is the union of all Fk's\\nThe above algorithm looks like the Apriori algorithm. One main difference is however the generation of candidate sets. Let us assume that:\\nA ‚Üí B and A ‚Üí C\\nare two frequent 2-sequences. The items involved in these sequences are (A, B) and (A,C) respectively. The candidate generation in a usual Apriori style would give (A, B, C) as a 3-itemset, but in the present context we\\nget the following 3-sequences as a result of joining the above 2- sequences\\nA ‚Üí B ‚Üí C, A ‚Üí C ‚Üí B and A ‚Üí BC\\nThe candidate‚Äìgeneration phase takes this into account. The GSP algorithm discovers frequent sequences, allowing for time constraints such as maximum gap and minimum gap among the sequence elements.\\nMoreover, it supports the notion of a sliding window, i.e., of a time interval within which items are observed as belonging to the same event, even if they originate from different events.\\nSequence mining\\nR.

The classification procedure (x) converts a discrete output function (y) to an input variable.\\nNumerous issues can be solved using classification algorithms, such as image recognition, sentiment analysis, medical\\ndiagnosis, and spam email detection. The classification algorithm to be used is determined by the nature of the data as well as\\nthe specific requirements of the problem at hand, as different algorithms may perform better for different types of data and\\ntasks.\\nRecommended Course\\xa0\\n\\xa0Decode DSA with C++\\nFull Stack Data Science Pro Course\\xa0\\nJava For Cloud Course\\xa0\\nFull Stack Web Development Course\\nData Analytics Course\\xa0\\nLearners in Classification Problems\\nThere are two types of learners if we look at them thoroughly.\\nLazy Learners\\xa0\\nThe training dataset is first stored, and then it awaits the arrival of the test dataset. When employing a lazy learner, the\\nclassification is performed using the most relevant information from the training dataset. Prediction time is increased while\\ntraining time is decreased. Some examples include case-based reasoning and the KNN algorithm.\\nEager Learners\\nEager students construct a classification model using a training dataset before obtaining a test dataset. They devote more\\ntime to studying than forecasting. Examples include decision trees, naive Bayes, and ANN.\\nClassification Algorithms\\nYou can pick from a wide variety of classification algorithms. The application and type of the available data set must be\\nconsidered when choosing the best option.\\nDecision Tree\\nA decision tree algorithm is a well-known machine-learning technique that can be used for classification and regression tasks.\\nIt is a supervised learning algorithm that divides the dataset recursively into subsets based on the most significant attribute\\nor feature at each step. These splits form a tree-like structure, with each internal node representing a decision based on a\\nfeature, each branch representing an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node representing a class label or a numerical\\nvalue.\\nThe tree is built in a top-down, recursive, divide-and-conquer fashion. All attributes must be classified. Alternatively, they\\nshould be discretized ahead of time. Attributes at the top of the tree have a greater impact on classification and are identified\\nusing the concept of information gain.\\nNaive Bayes\\xa0\\nA straightforward and probabilistic machine learning algorithm called Naive Bayes is used for text classification and object\\nclassification.

When the conditional probability for a specific\\nattribute is zero, the prediction fails to be valid. This must be explicitly fixed with a Laplacian estimator.\\xa0\\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN)\\nArtificial neural networks, also known as ANNs, are a subset of machine learning algorithms used for various tasks, such as\\nclassification, regression, pattern recognition, and more. The term ‚ÄúArtificial Neural Networks‚Äù refers to a computational\\nmodel that was influenced by the composition and operation of the human brain.\\nThe model may have several hidden layers, depending on how complicated the function to be mapped is. These hidden layers\\ncan be used to model complex neural networks, like deep neural networks.\\xa0\\nHowever, when many hidden layers exist, training and adjusting the weights take a long time. Another disadvantage is that\\nthe model is difficult to interpret when compared to others, such as decision trees. This is because the learned weights have\\nan unknown symbolic meaning.\\nHowever, in most real-world applications, artificial neural networks have performed admirably. It can classify untrained\\npatterns and has a high tolerance for noisy data. Artificial neural networks typically perform better with continuous-valued\\ninputs and outputs.\\nK-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\\nKNN, which stands for ‚Äúk-Nearest Neighbors,‚Äù is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and\\nregression tasks. It is a simple and straightforward algorithm that predicts data points in a feature space based on their\\nsimilarity.\\nWhen an unknown discrete data set is received, it examines the closest k number of saved instances (nearest neighbors) and\\nreturns the most common class as the prediction. It returns the mean of the k closest neighbors for real-valued data.\\xa0\\nKNN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it makes no assumptions about the data distribution. It is suitable for a wide\\nrange of problems, particularly when the decision boundary is not overly complex. However, it can be computationally\\nexpensive for large datasets because each prediction requires calculating distances to all data points in the training set.\\nHow to Get Internship in 2023 For College Students : A Step-by-Step G\\nHow to Get Internship in 2023 For College Students : A Step-by-Step G‚Ä¶\\nHow to Evaluate a Classifier\\nPrecision and Recall\\xa0\\nPrecision is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while recall is the fraction of relevant instances\\nthat have been retrieved over the total number of relevant instances.\\nHoldout Method\\nOut of all the options, the holdout method is the one that is most frequently used to assess a classifier. The presented data set\\nis split into two partitions, test and train. 20% of the data is used for testing, and the remaining 80% is used for training. With\\nthe help of the training set, the model will be developed, and the secret test data will be used to gauge its propensity for\\nfuture prediction.\\nCross-Validation\\nOverfitting is a common problem in machine learning and occurs in most models. K-fold cross-validation can be conducted to\\nverify that the model is not overfitted. In this method, the data set is randomly partitioned into K-mutually exclusive subsets,\\neach approximately equal in size. One is kept for testing, while others are used for training.

It basically\\nconsists of a root node, branches, leaf nodes etc.\\xa0\\nDecision trees are used in regression tasks providing a simple and understandable model to the user. Each decision node\\nevaluates a feature, splitting the data into branches.\\xa0\\nLeaf nodes represent final outcomes or predictions. The tree is built using algorithms that select the best feature to split on at\\neach node. Techniques like pruning prevent overfitting.\\xa0\\nDecision trees are versatile handling classification and regression tasks, making them widely used for machine learning and\\ndata analysis.\\nLet Us Understand Decision Tree In Machine Learning More\\nClearly With An Example:\\nImagine you‚Äôre deciding whether to go for a walk with the help of a decision tree. The decision tree would start at the top with\\na question like,\\xa0\\n‚ÄúIs the weather sunny?‚Äù If yes, it might ask, ‚ÄúIs it windy?‚Äù If not windy, you go for a walk; if windy, you stay inside.\\xa0\\nIf the weather isn‚Äôt sunny, the decision tree might ask, ‚ÄúIs it raining?‚Äù If yes, stay inside; if no, you can still go for a walk. Each\\nquestion leads to different paths, like branches on a tree, until you reach a final decision at the end.\\nDecision Tree Terminologies:\\nRoot Node:\\nIt is the top most node in the decision tree from where the decision making process begins, it contains the initial input of a\\ndata and leads to further decision nodes.\\nDecision Nodes:\\xa0\\nNodes resulting from the splitting of root nodes are known as decision nodes, each decision node is further splitted into\\nanother decision nodes or leaf nodes.\\nLeaf Nodes:\\nLeaf nodes or terminal nodes are those nodes after which further division is not possible, when leaf node is divided further in\\nsuch a way that there is no further splitting of node possible it is then classified as leaf node.\\nSub Tree:\\xa0\\nSubtree can be classified as a small portion of a larger tree which consists of root nodes (determined after splitting of a large\\ntree) as well as nodes formed after splitting of that node.\\nPruning:\\nPruning refers to the process of removing branches or nodes that do not contribute significantly to the accuracy of the tree. It\\nhelps prevent overfitting and improves tree‚Äôs ability to admit new data.\\nBranch:\\nBranch is another name for Sub tree, a subsection of an entire tree is termed as a branch or subtree.\\nParent and Child Node:\\nA parent node is a node that is further divided into one or more nodes whereas a child node is classified as a node that is\\ndirectly connected to the parent node and is not divided further into any node.\\nExample Of Decision Tree In Machine Learning:\\nLets us understand decision tree with the help of an example given below:\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

What is the Purpose of Decision Tree ?\\n10.2. What is another name for a decision tree ?\\n10.3. What is a decision tree in machine learning?\\n10.4. How does a decision tree work?\\nSuppose, You want to go out to play. So you will make a decision tree as shown above.\\nHere, Weather is a root node.\\xa0\\nDecision tree will first ask ‚Äúwhat is the weather‚Äù there are three conditions weather can be: Sunny , Cloudy or Rainy.\\xa0\\nSunny, Cloudy and Rainy are Sub-Nodes here.\\nIf sunny, decision tree will further ask ‚Äúis the humidity high or normal‚Äù\\nIf high then the answer for playing outside will be ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and if normal the answer for playing outside will be ‚Äúyes‚Äù.\\nSimilarly, If we select cloudy the answer for playing outside will be ‚Äúyes‚Äù.\\nHow Decision Tree Algorithm Works:\\nLet us understand the basic algorithm of the decision tree in machine learning through the simple steps given below:\\nStart with the Root Node-\\xa0 Begin at the root node of the decision tree, which represents the entire dataset. Root\\nnodes basically contain the base question on which the entire tree is based.\\nAsking the Best Questions ‚Äì\\xa0 Evaluate each feature in the dataset to find the best one for splitting.\\nSplit the Dataset- Based on the answer provided to the questions of the above node, it is further divided into several\\nnodes.\\nCreating Leaf Nodes\\xa0 ‚Äì When the algorithm stops splitting, the final nodes are called leaf nodes. Each leaf node\\nrepresents a class or a predicted value.\\nMake Predictions ‚Äì To make predictions for new data, follow the decision path from the root node to a leaf node.\\nDecision Tree Assumptions:\\nDecision tree assumptions are used to make the algorithm simpler and faster. They help create easy-to-understand rules.\\nHowever, these assumptions may not always be true in real-world data, so we need to check how well the model works in\\npractice.\\nBelow are some common assumptions used while constructing a decision tree.\\nBinary Splits:\\nBinary splitting is an important concept in decision trees.\\nBinary splitting simplifies decision-making by breaking down complex choices into simpler yes/no decisions, leading to clear\\nand interpretable decision paths in the decision tree.\\nRecursive Partitioning:\\nRecursive partitioning process is a common process used in decision trees where each node is divided into child nodes and\\nthis process continues until the stopping criteria meets.\\nThis process helps in dividing large nodes into smaller sub nodes, making trees simplified and reducing complexity.\\nHomogeneity:\\nWhile splitting data at a node in a decision tree, the main aim is to create subsets that are as similar as possible.\\nHomogeneity in a decision tree ensures that the data within each node is relatively uniform, leading to clear and accurate\\ndecision-making.\\nTop-Down Greedy Approach:\\nTop-down Greedy Approach is used to construct a good and effective decision tree. In Top-Down greedy approach each split\\nis chosen to maximize information gain and minimize impurity at the current node.\\nOverfitting:\\nOverfitting happens when a decision tree model is too complex and captures data‚Äôs noise or random fluctuations, leading to\\npoor performance on new data. Overfitting can be prevented by simplifying the tree and by doing Data Augmentation.\\nEntropy:\\nEntropy basically helps us measure how mixed or disorganized our data is, which is useful for decision-making in machine\\nlearning algorithms like decision trees.\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nLet us understand Entropy more clearly with an example:\\nImagine we have a basket of fruits, and we want to organize them based on their colors. We have three red apples, two green\\napples, and one yellow banana.\\nEntropy is like a measure of how mixed up or disorganized our fruits are in terms of their colors.\\nLow Entropy: If all the fruits are the same color (e.g., all red apples), the entropy is low because it‚Äôs very organized and easy to\\npredict.\\nHigh Entropy: If the fruits are mixed in terms of colors (e.g., red, green, and yellow), the entropy is high because it‚Äôs more\\ndisorganized and are hard to predict.\\nInformation Gain:\\nInformation Gain is an important concept of Machine learning, mostly used in decision trees. Information gain is basically\\nused to measure the effectiveness of a feature in reducing uncertainty (entropy) and improving the overall decision-making\\nprocess of the Tree.\\nInformation Gain is calculated by calculating the difference between Current Entropy of the node (before splitting) and\\nweighted sum of entropy of all the sub nodes(after splitting)\\nThis Concept helps decision trees to determine which feature to split on first by quantifying how much a feature reduces\\nuncertainty in predicting outcomes using Information Gain feature leads to more effective and accurate decision-making.\\nWhen To Stop Splitting The Decision Tree:\\nKnowing when to stop splitting in a decision tree is crucial to prevent overfitting and ensure optimized and simplified\\nDecision trees.\\nThere are several ways through which will help you in stopping your Decision tree:\\nMaximum Depth: We can limit the depth of the tree by specifying a maximum depth. This prevents the tree from growing too\\ndeep and capturing noise in the data. This can be set by using Max_depth Parameter.\\nThe more will be the Depth, More complex the tree will be. So it is advised to keep the depth of the tree short.\\nApart from this, other common ways to stop splitting include: minimum sample split, Early stopping etc.\\nLearn Machine Learning with PW Skills:\\nEnroll in our Advanced AI Course to learn the principles, basics and knowledge of all the tools required for Machine Learning.\\nWhether you are a beginner or an individual looking to switch your career, this Machine Learning Course course will be a\\nright fit for you:\\xa0\\nProviding a roadmap, and knowledge of all the tools with updated syllabus curriculum , interactive classes, practice material,\\nregular doubt sessions and guidance from experienced teachers for your better understanding helps you to get your desired\\njob in the field of Machine Learning.\\nFAQs on Decision Tree\\nDecision tree is an important part of machine learning.The purpose for creating a decision tree is to make predictions\\nand decisions analyzing past predictions, also it helps us to analyze every outcome before making any decision.\\n‚Üê Previous Post\\nNext Post ‚Üí\\nWhat is the Purpose of Decision Tree ?\\nWhat is another name for a decision tree ?\\nWhat is a decision tree in machine learning?\\nHow does a decision tree work?\\nData Science with Generative AI Course\\n‚Çπ20000\\nExplore\\nMust Read\\nAmazon Summer\\nInternship 2025 for Data\\nScientists ‚Äì An Effective\\nGuide\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 23, 2025\\nThe Summer Internship Program for\\nthe Year 2025 at Amazon: Your\\nGateway to a Data Scientist Career\\nAre you a‚Ä¶\\nData Labeling: What It Is,\\nHow It Works, and Why It\\nMatters in 2025\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 17, 2025\\nIn an age where the pot is really\\nboiling for all sorts of artificial\\nintelligence and machine-learning\\nterms, ‚Äúdata labeling‚Äù‚Ä¶\\nData Lake vs Data\\nWarehouse: Which One\\nShould You Choose in\\n2025?\\nBy Vanita Mishra / July 16, 2025\\nToday, efficiency is crucial in\\nmanaging and storing data in the\\ndata-driven world; therefore, people\\nneed to learn how to‚Ä¶\\nsupport@pwskills.com\\n\\uf0e0\\n+91 8448982581\\n\\uf879\\n\\uf08c\\n\\uf167\\n\\uf2c6\\nCompany\\nAbout us\\nFAQ\\nPrivacy policy\\nContact us\\nJob assistance\\nTerms and condition\\nProducts\\nPW Skills Lab\\nExperience Portal\\nHall Of fame\\nJob Portal\\nBecome an affiliate\\nBlog\\n'}, {'Logistic Regression Machine Learning.pdf': 'Home ¬ª Data Science ¬ª Logistic Regression Machine Learning\\nData Science\\nLogistic Regression Machine Learning\\nLogistic regression machine learning is an important technique for predicting future outcomes.

It is widely used in predictive\\nmodeling to estimate the chances that a given instance falls into a specific category.\\xa0\\nFor example, in binary classification, 0 represents a negative class, while 1 represents a positive class. Logistic regression is\\nmainly effective for problems where the binary outcome variable indicates one of two possible categories (0 or 1). Some\\ncommon real-life examples of situations where this binary response is expected include-\\n1. Predicting Heart Attacks: Logistic regression can help in predicting the chances of a heart attack based on factors like\\nage, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. By analyzing these variables, the model can predict whether a person is at\\nrisk (1) or not (0).\\n2. Estimating University Admission: Logistic regression can predict a student‚Äôs chances of getting admission into a\\nuniversity by looking at grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities. The model predicts if the student will be\\nadmitted (1) or not (0).\\n3. Identifying Spam Emails: Logistic regression can classify emails as spam or not by analyzing features like focus\\nkeywords, sender information, and email structure. The model predicts if an email is spam (1) or not (0).\\nKey Advantages Of Logistic Regression\\nLogistic regression machine learning has several key advantages and features that make it a standout choice from other\\nregression techniques, some of the key advantages of this include-\\xa0\\n1. Simple And Efficient: Logistic regression is straightforward and easy to understand. It‚Äôs one of the simplest machine\\nlearning algorithms, providing efficient features to handle large datasets and make predictions quickly.\\n2. Easily Interpretable: The results of logistic regression are easy to interpret. The predictions can be directly translated\\ninto meaningful insights that help in making quick decisions.\\n3. Feature Importance: Logistic regression machine learning allows you to understand the impact of each feature on the\\nprediction. This helps in identifying which factors are most influential in determining the outcome.\\n4. Flexibility: It can be used for a wide range of classification problems, from medical diagnosis to email filtering, making\\nit a flexible tool in various fields.\\n5. Handles Linearly Separable Data Well: Logistic regression machine learning works particularly well when the classes\\nare linearly separable, meaning a clear boundary can be drawn between the different classes.\\n6. Probability Estimates: It provides probabilities for each situations, which can be useful for making informed decisions.\\nFor example, knowing the probability of a customer making a purchase can help businesses in making prior marketing\\nstrategies.\\nThese advantages make logistic regression a valuable and accessible tool for anyone starting with machine learning.\\nLogistic Regression Machine Learning ‚Äì Sigmoid\\nFunction\\nLogistic regression machine learning is used to predict binary outcomes, such as yes/no or true/false. The key equation of\\nlogistic regression is the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. It transforms the linear equation output into a\\nprobability between 0 and 1.\\nAdditionally, in logistic regression, after calculating the probability using the sigmoid function, we compare it to a set\\nthreshold. If the probability is above this threshold, the model predicts that the situation belongs to a certain class. whereas,\\nif the probability falls below the threshold, the model predicts that the situation does not belong to that class. This threshold\\ndetermines the decision boundary for classifying data into different categories based on their estimated probabilities.\\nThe sigmoid function is basically an activation function for logistic regression and is defined as ‚Äì\\xa0\\nWhere,\\ne = Base of natural logarithms.\\nx = numerical value one wishes to transform\\nEquation For Logistic Regression\\nLogistic regression is a statistical method used to predict binary outcomes by fitting data to a logistic curve.

What is the sigmoid function and why is it important?\\n9.2. How do you handle multicollinearity in logistic regression?\\n9.3. What are the key assumptions of logistic regression?\\nKey Assumptions For Implementing Logistic Regression\\xa0\\nLogistic regression basically depends on several key assumptions to ensure its validity and reliability in making predictions.\\nHere are the six key assumptions that will help you to understand the concept better.\\n1. Binary Outcome\\xa0\\nThe very first assumption of logistic regression is that the variables should be binary, meaning it can take only two possible\\noutcomes. For example ‚Äì 0/1, yes/no, male/female, pass/fail, etc.\\n2. Independence of Observations\\xa0\\nThe observations used to fit the model must be independent of each other. This means that the occurrence of one\\nobservation should not affect the occurrence of another observation. This observation can generally be verified by potting\\nresiduals against time, which help in the prediction of dependencies if present.\\n3. Linearity of Independent Variables and Log Odds\\xa0\\nLogistic regression machine learning assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of\\nthe dependent variable is linear. This linearity ensures that changes in independent variables result in a proportional change\\nin the log odds.\\xa0Here, Long Odds are different from probabilities, they refer to the ratio of success to failure, while probability\\nrefers to the ratio of success to everything that can occur.\\nLet us understand what long odd is, with an example-: consider that you play 15 boxing matches with your opponent. Here,\\nthe long odds of your winning are 7 to 8, while the probability of your winning is 7 to 15 (as the total games played = 15).\\n4. No Multicollinearity among Independent Variables\\xa0\\nThis assumption of logistic regression machine learning states that there should be little or no multicollinearity among the\\nindependent variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each\\nother, which can affect the model‚Äôs performance and lead to wrongful interpretation of coefficients.\\n5. Large Sample Size\\xa0\\nLogistic regression generally performs better with a large sample size. A larger sample size provides more reliable estimates\\nof the model parameters and helps ensure the stability of the model.\\n6. No Outliers\\xa0\\nAnother critical assumption of Logistic regression machine learning is its sensitivity to outliers.\\nOutliners are data points that basically deviate from the rest of the data. Outliers can influence the estimated coefficients\\nand predictions, which often leads to biased results.\\nThese assumptions are important to consider when applying logistic regression to ensure that the model accurately captures\\nthe relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the binary outcome. Violations of these\\nassumptions can lead to unreliable predictions and interpretations.\\nTypes Of Logistic Regression With Examples\\nLogistic regression machine learning is basically classified into three types, namely- binary, multinomial, and ordinal. Each of\\nthese three types is different from one another in terms of theory and execution. Let‚Äôs understand each of these types in\\ndetail with the help of an example below.\\n1. Binary Logistic Regression:\\nBinary logistic regression generally predicts a binary outcome, where the dependent variable has only two possible outcomes\\n(e.g., yes/no, pass/fail).\\nExample:\\xa0\\nPredicting whether a patient has a heart disease: Outcome ‚Äì Yes/No\\nEvaluating the risk of cancer: Outcome = high or low.\\n2. Multinomial Logistic Regression\\nMultinomial logistic regression predicts outcomes with more than two categories, but the categories are not ordered. Each\\ncategory in this type is compared to a reference category.\\nExample:\\xa0\\nPredicting a person‚Äôs preferred mode of transportation which can be car, bus, or bike.\\nPredicting the most popular transportation type for 2040 which can be electric cars, electric trains, electric buses, and\\nelectric bikes.\\n3. Ordinal Logistic Regression\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nOrdinal logistic regression is basically used when the dependent variable is in the ordered state. It predicts outcomes with\\nordered categories. The categories have a meaningful order, but the differences between categories may not be equal.\\nExample:\\xa0\\nPredicting a customer‚Äôs satisfaction level which can be low, medium, or high\\nPredicting the shirt‚Äôs size for the customer which can be XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL\\nEach type of logistic regression serves different purposes depending on the nature of the outcome variable and the data\\navailable for analysis. Understanding these different types helps in selecting the appropriate type of logistic regression for a\\nspecific predictive modeling task.\\nLogistic Regression Best Practices\\xa0\\nLogistic regression can produce an accurate model by following some best practices. These best practices basically ensure\\nthat logistic regression models are strong, reliable, accurate, and provide valuable insights for decision-making in various\\nfields.\\xa0\\nBelow are some of the most important logistic regression machine learning techniques that will help you to understand this\\nbetter.\\n1. Identify Dependent Variables: Select outcome variables that are relevant to your research question and align with\\nthe binary or categorical nature required for logistic regression. Ensure these variables accurately reflect the\\nphenomenon you aim to predict or understand, such as customer purchase behavior or disease presence.\\n2. Discover Technical Requirements of the Model: Understand and apply technical aspects of logistic regression,\\nincluding the need for independence of observations, appropriate variable scaling or transformation, and handling of\\nmulticollinearity. Meeting these requirements ensures the model‚Äôs accuracy and reliability in predicting probabilities.\\n3. Appropriately Interpret the Results: Interpret coefficients to understand how each independent variable influences\\nthe probability of the outcome. Positive coefficients increase the probability of the outcome, while negative\\ncoefficients decrease it. Ensure interpretations align with the model‚Äôs assumptions and are meaningful within the\\ncontext of your study.\\n4. Validate Observed Results: Another important practice that users can implement is validating the observed results\\nwith a sample of the original dataset using techniques like cross-validation or out-of-sample testing.\\xa0\\nThis method makes the model results more reliable, especially when working with smaller samples.\\nLearn Data Science With PW Skills\\nJoin our PW Skills Data Science with Generative AI Course to dive into the world of data science along with the essence of\\nArtificial intelligence.

Independent variables are also called predictors, and dependent variables\\nare known as target variables or outcomes. The main objective of the regression analysis is to analyze the relationship, which\\nhelps make predictions and identify patterns or derive conclusions based on the data.\\xa0\\nIt helps to answer what changes will be observed in the dependent variable with the change in independent variables. In\\nregression, we analyze data through graphs and check the variable that best fits the data points in the plot.\\xa0\\nWhy Use Regression Analysis?\\nThere are various applications of regression analysis in data analysis. Regression analysis predicts a possible outcome based\\non the continuous variable. Regression data analysis determines the relationship between dependent and independent\\nvariables. It helps to predict or forecast based on historical data, which helps to anticipate some of the future outcomes like\\nsales, stock prices, etc.\\xa0\\nIt helps to find trends in data and predict real or continuous values. It can help make predictions more accurately, like sales\\npredictions, marketing trends, and weather conditions.\\xa0\\nIt also helps understand the relationships between different variables and analyze how changes in one variable affect the\\nother. It helps in hypothesis testing and helps researchers determine if specific factors affect the favorable outcome.\\nTypes Of Regression Analysis\\nThere are different types of Regression analysis in data science and machine learning. Regression analysis analyzes the effect\\nof the independent and dependent variables. Let us discuss major important types of regression.\\xa0\\nLinear Regression\\xa0\\nLinear regression is a statistical method used to analyze and model the relationship between dependent and independent\\nvariables.

It is used to solve different regression problems in machine learning.\\xa0\\nLinear regression represents the linear relationship between independent variables and dependent variables. It represents\\nindependent variables on the X-axis and dependent variables on the Y-axis.\\xa0\\nThere are two types of Linear Regression. One with only a single input variable, also known as simple linear regression.

The dependent\\nvariables in these types of problems are in the discrete form, like 0 and 1. They work with boolean values such as true or false,\\nyes or no, etc. It works on probability concepts. Regression uses them to calculate the relationship between the dependent\\nand independent variables. It should be kept in mind that the size of the data to be taken is large and that there is no\\ncorrelation between any of the independent variables in the data.\\nUnlike linear regression, it predicts the possibility that an observation belongs to one of the two classes. It uses a logistic\\nfunction to map any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1. These two numbers represent the probability.

Linear regression\\n2. Polynomial regression\\n3. Logistics Regression\\nLinear Regression\\nLinear regression in machine learning is a method used to understand and predict the relationship between two variables,\\nthese two variables are basically referred to as the input variable (independent variable) and the output variable (dependent\\nvariable). The goal of linear regression is to find a linear equation that best fits the data points, allowing us to make\\npredictions about the output variable based on the input variable.\\nLet us understand linear regression with a simple example to make it more clear:\\nImagine plotting points on a graph where one axis represents the input variable (like temperature) and the other axis\\nrepresents the output variable (like ice cream sales). Linear regression helps us draw a line through these points that shows\\nthe general trend or pattern in the data. This line can then be used to estimate the ice cream sales (output value) based on the\\ntemperature (input values).\\xa0\\nHence, we can say that linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning for understanding and predicting\\nlinear relationships between variables.\\nConsider this diagram and relate this with an example shared above, where temperature is an independent variable and\\nicecream is a dependent variable which is dependent on temperature.\\nIf the temperature rises, sales of ice cream will also increase and vice versa.\\nPositive Linear Relationship\\nIn this type of linear relationship if the dependent variable on the Y axis rises, the independent variable on the X axis will also\\nrise.\\nExample of this type of variable is shown in the picture above.\\nNegative Linear Relationship\\nIn this type of relationship, the dependent variable on the Y-axis decreases and the independent variable at the X-axis will\\nincrease.\\nExample of the same is given below for your reference.\\nGradient Descent\\nGradient descent is a method used in linear regression to find the best parameters for the linear equation that fits the data. It\\nis basically a optimization technique that iteratively adjusts the parameters of the linear equation to minimize the difference\\nbetween predicted and actual values, helping us find the best-fitting line for our data\\nIn simple terms, it‚Äôs like adjusting the slope and intercept of the line until it aligns closely with the actual data points.\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

Clustering\\nmachine learning looks at data points and tries to find similarities between them. It then groups these similar data points into\\nclusters, so that items in the same cluster are more alike than those in other clusters. This process doesn‚Äôt need any prior\\ninformation or labels; it just finds natural groupings in the data.\\nFor example, if you have a list of people‚Äôs ages and incomes, clustering machine learning algorithm can help in grouping them\\ninto categories, like ‚Äúyoung people with low income‚Äù or ‚Äúolder people with high income.‚Äù It‚Äôs useful in many areas, like\\ncustomer segmentation, medical research or in MNCs to find sales patterns.\\nTypes Of Clustering In Machine Learning\\nThere are various types of clustering in machine learning used to group similar data points together, each algorithm is unique\\nin its own way offering different functions and features. Some of the popularly used clustering algorithms are explained\\nbelow for your better understanding of the topic:\\n1. Centroid-Based Clustering:\\nCentroid-based clustering is a simple way to group data into a defined number of clusters. A popular algorithm in this\\ncategory is K-means. Let us understand below how it works:\\nK-means Clustering In Machine Learning: This method divides data into a pre-specified number of groups, called clusters.\\nEach cluster has a central point called a ‚Äúcentroid.‚Äù The algorithm starts by randomly placing these centroids and then\\nassigning each data point to the nearest centroid. The centroids are then recalculated based on the average of all data points\\nin the cluster, and the process is repeated until the centroids no longer change much. The main goal of repetition is to\\nminimize the distance between data points and their respective centroids.\\n2. Hierarchical Clustering:\\nHierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of the data points. There are two main approaches used in this type of\\ntechnique, both of the approaches are explained below for your reference:\\nAgglomerative Clustering: This method starts with each data point as its own cluster. Then, it repeatedly merges the\\nclosest clusters together until all points are in one big cluster. This creates a tree structure where the bottom leaves\\nare individual data points, and the root is the single final cluster.\\nDivisive Clustering: This is the opposite of agglomerative clustering. It starts with all data points in one cluster and\\nsplits them into smaller clusters, these smaller clusters continue to split until each point is its own cluster.\\nBoth of these methods can be visualized using a dendrogram. Which is basically a diagram that shows the arrangement of the\\nclusters formed.\\n3. Density-Based Clustering:\\nDensity-based clustering groups data points based on their density in the data space. Some of the majorly used techniques in\\nDB clustering machine learning are explained below for your better understanding\\nDBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): This method finds clusters of different\\nshapes by looking for areas where data points are densely packed together. It can handle well the points that don‚Äôt\\nbelong to any cluster. It is especially useful when clusters are of varying shapes and sizes.\\nOPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure): It is quite similar to DBSCAN but it is much better\\nthan it at identifying clusters in data with varying densities.\\n4. Distribution-Based Clustering:\\nDistribution-based clustering is a method that basically groups data points based on the pre-assumption that they belong to a\\nspecific distribution. It assumes that the data comes from a mixture of different distributions, and each cluster is represented\\nby one of these distributions.\\nThis method is flexible because it can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes, unlike some other clustering methods that\\nassume all clusters are similar in shape.\\nThese clustering methods offer different ways to group data based on their similarities, making them valuable tools for\\nanalyzing complex datasets in a simple and efficient manner.\\nClustering In Machine Learning Applications\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

This training dataset includes\\nboth correct and incorrect results, allowing the model to improve over time. The loss function is used to determine the\\nalgorithm‚Äôs accuracy, and iterations are performed until the error is sufficiently reduced.\\xa0\\nDifference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Lear\\nDifference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Lear‚Ä¶\\nThere are two types of supervised learning problems in data mining:\\nAn algorithm is used in classification to classify test data into different categories precisely. Specific entities in the\\ndataset are identified, and an attempt is made to determine how these entities should be defined or labeled. Examples\\nof popular classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, K-nearest\\nneighbors, and random forests.\\nRegression is a statistical method for determining the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

The\\nmost popular learning techniques, which are typically calculated using software like R or Python, are briefly described below:\\nNeural Network\\nThe Neural Network is specially designed for deep learning algorithms, Neural networks process training data by simulating\\nthe interconnectivity of the human brain via layers of nodes.\\xa0\\nEvery node has inputs, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. If the output value exceeds a certain threshold, the node\\n‚Äúfires‚Äù or activates, and data is sent to the next network layer. Neural networks learn this mapping function via supervised\\nlearning, with gradient descent adjustments made in response to the loss function. We can be confident in the model‚Äôs\\naccuracy to produce the right answer when the cost function is at or close to zero.\\nNaive Bayes\\nNaive Bayes is a classification approach based on the Bayes theorem‚Äôs principle of class conditional independence.

This\\nmethod is most commonly used in text classification, spam detection, and recommendation systems.\\nLinear Regression\\nSimple linear regression is used when only one independent variable and one dependent variable are present. Simple linear\\nregression is used when there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable.\\nWhen the quantity of independent variables rises, multiple linear regression is employed. Each type of linear regression\\nattempts to plot a line of best fit determined by the least squares method. Compared to other regression models, this line is\\nstraight when plotted on a graph.\\nLogistic regression\\nLogistic regression is used when the dependent variable is classified with binary outputs such as ‚Äútrue‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù or ‚Äúyes‚Äù\\nand ‚Äúno.‚Äù While both regression models seek to understand relationships between data inputs, logistic regression is primarily\\nused to solve binary classification problems like spam detection.\\nK-nearest neighbor\\nThe KNN algorithm, also known as the K-nearest neighbor, is a non-parametric algorithm for classifying data points based on\\ntheir proximity and association with other available data. This algorithm assumes that data points with similar characteristics\\ncan be found nearby.\\xa0\\nAs a result, it attempts to calculate the distance between data points, typically using Euclidean distance, and then assigns a\\ncategory based on the most frequently occurring category or average. It is popular among data scientists due to its ease of\\nuse and short calculation time, but as the test dataset grows, so does the processing time, making it less appealing for\\nclassification tasks.\\xa0 KNN is commonly employed in recommendation engines and image recognition.\\xa0\\nSupport vector machines (SVM)\\nA support vector machine (SVM) is a popular supervised learning model developed by Vladimir Vapnik that can be used for\\ndata classification as well as regression. It is, however, most commonly used for classification problems, where it constructs a\\nhyperplane with the greatest distance between two classes of data points. The decision boundary is the hyperplane that\\nseparates the data point classes (for example, oranges vs. apples) on either side of the plane.\\nSupervised Learning Examples\\nA variety of business applications, including the following, can be built and advanced using supervised learning models:\\nImage and object recognition: Supervised learning algorithms can be used to locate, isolate, and categorize objects in\\nvideos or images, making them useful when applied to various computer vision techniques and imagery analysis.\\nPredictive analytics: Using supervised learning models to build predictive analytics systems that provide deep\\ninsights into various business data points is a common use case. This enables businesses to forecast specific outcomes\\nbased on a given output variable, assisting business leaders in justifying decisions or pivoting for the organization‚Äôs\\nbenefit.\\nCustomer sentiment analysis: Organizations can extract and classify important pieces of information from large\\nvolumes of data, such as context, emotion, and intent, with minimal human intervention by using supervised machine\\nlearning algorithms. This can be extremely helpful in gaining a better understanding of customer interactions and in\\nimproving brand engagement efforts.\\nSpam detection: Another example of a supervised learning model is spam detection. Organizations can effectively\\norganize spam and non-spam correspondences by training databases to recognize patterns or anomalies in new data\\nusing supervised classification algorithms.\\nChallenges of Supervised Learning\\nAlthough supervised learning can offer businesses advantages such as deep data insights and improved automation, there\\nare some challenges when building sustainable supervised learning models. The following are some of these challenges:\\nSupervised learning models can require certain levels of expertise to structure accurately.\\nTraining supervised learning models can be very time-intensive.\\nDatasets can have a higher likelihood of human error, resulting in algorithms learning incorrectly.\\nUnlike unsupervised learning models, supervised learning cannot cluster or classify data on its own.\\nSupervised Learning FAQs\\nQ1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of supervised machine learning?\\nAns. Supervised learning excels at classification and regression problems, such as determining the category of a news article\\nor forecasting sales volume for a given future date.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial\\nintelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being specially programmed\\nto do so.\\xa0\\nInstead of following a set of fixed instructions, machine learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships within the\\ndata to improve their performance over time. For example, machine learning is used in recommendations on streaming\\nservices, email spam filtering, and even in the concept of self-driving cars. It basically helps systems to adapt and get better\\nwith their usage, making it a powerful tool for solving complex problems and enhancing everyday technologies.\\nTypes Of Machine Learning\\nThere are various types of machine learning techniques available, each with special features and uses. Some of the common\\ntypes of machine learning algorithms used in our day-to-day life are as follows:\\nSupervised Machine Learning\\nUnsupervised Machine Learning\\nSemi-Supervised Machine Learning\\nReinforcement Learning\\nWe have explained below, each one of these types of machine learning in detail along with their applications and\\ncharacteristics, let us move further and understand it in a better way.\\n1. Supervised Learning\\nSupervised learning is one of the important types of machine learning algorithms, where the algorithm is trained using\\nlabeled data. This means that the data provided to the algorithm includes input-output pairs, where the correct output is\\nalready known. The algorithm learns from this data by finding patterns and relationships between the inputs and the outputs.\\nOnce the model is trained, It can predict the output for new, unseen data based on what it has learned. A simple example of\\nthis algorithm is written below that will help you to clear your concept.\\nExample of Supervised Learning\\nConsider a scenario where you need to build a model to classify different types of fruits. You start by feeding the algorithm a\\ndataset of images of fruits, where each image is labeled with the type of fruit it represents, such as apples, bananas, and\\noranges. The algorithm learns to recognize the features that differentiate one fruit from another, like shape, color, and size.\\nWhen you later input a new image of a fruit that the algorithm has never seen before, it will use the learned patterns to\\npredict whether the fruit is an apple, banana, or orange. This process tells how supervised learning works.\\nTypes Of Supervised Learning\\xa0\\nThe supervised learning algorithm is further classified into two main types that include: Classification Learning and\\nRegression Learning. Let us understand each of these types in detail and see what are they used for.\\nClassification Learning\\nClassification learning is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to categorize data into specific classes or groups. The\\nalgorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with a predefined category.

How is reinforcement learning different from supervised and unsupervised learning?\\n10.3. Why is semi-supervised learning known as a hybrid approach?\\nLogistic Regression\\nSupport Vector Machine\\nRandom Forest\\nDecision Tree\\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\\nNaive Bayes\\nRegression Learning\\nRegression learning is another type of supervised learning where the aim is to predict a continuous value rather than a\\ncategory. The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset with input-output pairs, where the output is a numerical value. For\\nexample, in predicting house prices, the algorithm learns from features such as square foot area, number of bedrooms, and\\nlocation. The model uses this information to predict the price of a new house based on its features. Regression is useful in\\nmany fields, including finding stock price predictions, forecasting economic trends, and many other scenarios.\\nSome Common Algorithms Used In Regression Learning Techniques Include\\nLinear Regression\\nPolynomial Regression\\nRidge Regression\\nLasso Regression\\nDecision tree\\nRandom Forest\\nAdvantages of Supervised Machine Learning\\nBeing trained on labeled data, these models generally have high accuracy.\\nThe decision-making process in supervised learning is meaningful\\nThis model generally takes less time than any other learning algorithm, as it generally uses labeled data and pre-\\ntrained models.\\nDisadvantages of Supervised Machine Learning\\nIt can not work on unlabeled data which can be a problem sometime.\\nIt can be costly as it requires special efforts to label the data first.\\n2. Unsupervised Learning\\xa0\\nUnsupervised learning is also one of the most used types of machine learning technique where the algorithm is given data\\nwithout any labels or predefined categories. The main goal of this algorithm is to find patterns or relationships within the\\ndata. Instead of being told what to look for, the algorithm identifies common characteristics on its own, grouping similar data\\npoints together. This is useful for discovering hidden patterns, grouping similar items, or reducing the amount of the data for\\nfurther analysis. An example of this algorithm is written below for your better clarity and understanding.\\nExample Of Unsupervised Learning\\xa0\\nImagine you have a dataset containing various books and their features like genre, author, number of pages, and publication\\nyear. Through clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm can group similar books together based on these features. This\\nwill reveal a group of books that belong to specific genres or those written by the same author. Bookstores can use this\\ninformation to organize their inventory more effectively or to recommend similar books to customers.\\nTypes Of Unsupervised Learning\\xa0\\nUnsupervised learning is further classified into two main types that include: Clustering and Association. Let us understand\\neach of these types in detail and see what are they used for.\\nClustering in Unsupervised Learning\\nClustering is a technique in unsupervised learning where the algorithm groups data points based on their similarities. Each\\ngroup, or cluster, contains data points that are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. This method is used\\nin various fields like- in customer segmentation, clustering can group customers with similar purchasing behaviors, allowing\\nbusinesses to personalize different marketing strategies for different customers.\\nSome of the commonly used clustering algorithms include:\\nK-Means Clustering algorithm\\nMean-shift algorithm\\nDBSCAN Algorithm\\nPrincipal Component Analysis\\nIndependent Component Analysis\\nAssociation in Unsupervised Learning\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nAssociation in unsupervised learning is a method used to discover interesting relationships or patterns between variables in\\nlarge datasets. This technique identifies rules that highlight how the occurrence of one item is associated with the occurrence\\nof another item. For example, in market basket analysis, an association algorithm can reveal that customers who buy bread\\nare likely to buy butter also. Businesses use these association rules to optimize product placements and improve inventory\\nmanagement.\\nSome of the commonly used Association rule learning algorithms include:\\nApriori Algorithm\\nEclat\\nFP-growth Algorithm\\nAdvantages of Unsupervised Machine Learning\\nUnsupervised learning helps to discover hidden patterns and relationships between the data.\\nUseful for tasks such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data exploration.\\nReduces the efforts of data labeling as labeled data is not used here.\\nDisadvantages of Unsupervised Machine Learning\\nIt is difficult to predict the quality of the model as labeled data is not used here.\\nClustering of the data may not be perfect as it is done without label.\\n3. Semi-Supervised Learning\\nSemi-supervised learning is another one of the most used types of machine learning technique that uses a small amount of\\nlabeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data. The labeled data helps the model learn to make predictions, while the\\nunlabeled data helps in improving the model‚Äôs accuracy by providing additional information about the structure of the data. A\\ncommon example of Semi-supervised learning is written below for you better understanding of the concept.\\nExample Of Semi-Supervised Learning\\nImagine you want to build a model to classify emails as spam or not spam. You have 100 labeled emails with labels of ‚Äúspam‚Äù\\nor ‚Äúnot spam‚Äù and 1000 unlabeled emails. In semi-supervised learning, you start by training the model on the 100 labeled\\nemails. Once the model is built, you use it to predict labels for the 1000 unlabeled emails. These predictions are not always\\ncorrect, but they provide additional information. This process helps the model to better understand the features and patterns\\nin the emails, resulting in improved performance.\\nTypes Of Semi-Supervised Learning\\nThere are various semi-supervised learning models each used for different purposes and having different characteristics\\nfrom one another. Let us understand each of its types briefly.\\n1. Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning: These models use graphs to represent the relationships between data\\npoints. Labels are spread from labeled to unlabeled points through these connections.\\n2. Label Propagation: This model is used to spread the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data through a network,\\nassuming that similar data points are close to each other.\\n3. Co-training: This approach trains two or more different models to label the unlabeled data. Each model trains on\\ndifferent parts of the data, and their predictions are used to improve each other.\\n4. Self-training: The model first trains the labeled data, and then predicts values for the unlabeled data. These new\\npredictions are added to the training set, and the model is retrained.\\nAdvantages Of Semi-Supervised Machine Learning\\nIt is better than supervised and unsupervised learning, as it works on both labeled as well as unlabeled data.\\nIt is suitable for large data sets.\\nDisadvantages Of Semi-Supervised Machine Learning\\nThese methods are more complex as compared to other approaches.\\nAvailability of labeled data is must in this algorithm, which makes it unsuitable when labeled data is not available.\\nThe model performance can be affected due to unlabeled data being present.\\n4. Reinforcement Learning\\xa0\\nReinforcement learning is a types of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an\\nenvironment to maximize a reward. The agent starts without knowledge of the best actions and learns through the trial and\\nerror method. Every action has a consequence, resulting in a reward or punishment. Over the period of time, the agent aims\\nto choose actions that give the highest cumulative reward. A common example of reinforcement learning is written below for\\nyour better clarity of the concept.\\nExample Of Reinforcement Learning\\nImagine training a dog to fetch a ball. The environment is your yard, the agent is the dog, and the action is fetching the ball.\\nWhen the dog brings the ball back, you reward it with a treat. If the dog doesn‚Äôt fetch the ball or does something else, it\\ndoesn‚Äôt receive a treat which is a negative reward.\\xa0\\nIn the starting stage, the dog may not understand what to do, but over a period of time, it learns that fetching the ball leads to\\na treat. The dog‚Äôs goal is to get more rewards by fetching more balls. Through repeated experiences and rewards, the dog\\nimproves its fetching behavior.\\nTypes Of Reinforcement Learning\\xa0\\nThere are primarily three types of reinforcement learning techniques, each having different characteristics and each used for\\ndifferent purposes. Let us understand the working of each technique with the explanation given below-\\nQ-learning\\nQ-learning is a simple and popular reinforcement learning technique. It uses a Q-table to store values representing the\\nexpected future rewards of taking a specific action in a specific state. The agent updates the Q-values based on the rewards\\nreceived, and over time, it learns the optimal actions to take in each state to maximize its overall reward.\\nSARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)\\nSARSA is another reinforcement learning technique similar to Q-learning, but it updates the Q-values based on the action the\\nagent actually takes rather than the best possible action. This makes SARSA more conservative and ensures the agent learns\\nbased on the current policy.\\nApplications Of Machine Learning Algorithms\\nIn this modern era, where everything is relying on technology, machine learning has various important applications in our\\nday-to-day lives. Here are some key applications of machine learning, that will help you to understand its importance:\\nMachine learning algorithms can identify objects, people, and activities in images and videos, as well as can also\\ninterpret spoken language.\\nIt is also used for sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbots, helping machines understand and respond to\\nhuman language.\\nMachine learning algorithms also assist doctors in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and personalizing\\ntreatment plans based on patient data.\\nThese Algorithms enhance fraud detection, predict trading prices, and improve credit scoring and risk management.\\nThese different types of Machine learning algorithms are used by companies like Amazon and Netflix to suggest\\nproducts or content based on user preferences.\\nDifferent types of machine learning algorithms are used in self-driving cars to analyze their environment, make\\ndecisions, and navigate safely.\\nML algorithms are used in virtual assistants and chatbots to provide instant support and improve customer\\ninteraction.\\nDifferent types of Machine Learning techniques are used to create intelligent non-player characters to improve game\\nexperience.\\nML techniques also help in predicting equipment failures in industries, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.\\nLearn Machine Learning With PW Skills\\nStart your journey into the world of AI with our detailed PW Skills Generative AI And Data Science Course specially\\ndesigned to serve candidates with different skill sets.

It uses\\ndiagrams, symbols, and text to represent data and shows how they relate to each other. This process is the first important\\nstep in defining how data is structured and used in a system.\\xa0\\nData Modeling involves creating data models that describe how data is connected with each other. These models are then\\neventually used to build databases or update old software systems. By using data modeling, companies ensure consistency in\\nhow data is named, organized, and secured, which ultimately helps in improving their data analysis\\xa0process. The main focus is\\non making data available and well-organized to the team, regardless of how it is applied.\\nTypes Of Data Models\\nDesigning a database or information system starts with a simple idea and gradually becomes more detailed. Data models,\\nwhich represent the structure of the data, can be grouped into three types based on how detailed they are: conceptual,\\nlogical, and physical.\\xa0\\nThe process usually begins with a conceptual model, then moves to a logical model, and finally ends with a physical model. Let\\nus understand each of these models in detail with the help of the diagram given below:\\nTypes Of Data Models\\n1. Conceptual Data Models\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese models are also known as domain models and they basically give an overview of what the system will include, how it\\nwill be organized, and the main business rules involved. Conceptual models are created early in the project to help in\\ngathering requirements. They identify important things that need to be represented in the system, their attributes, and how\\nthey relate to each other. These models also consider security and data integrity, but they are usually simple and\\nstraightforward.\\n2. Logical Data Models\\nLogical models are more detailed than conceptual models. They describe the data and relationships in the system more\\nprecisely, often using formal notation systems. Logical models also define data attributes, such as data types and sizes, but\\nthey don‚Äôt get into technical system details.\\xa0\\nThese models are sometimes skipped in agile or DevOps practices but are useful in projects that are data-focused, like\\ndesigning data warehouses or reporting systems.\\n3. Physical Data Models\\xa0\\xa0\\nPhysical models are the most detailed data models, they basically show how data will be stored in a database. These models\\nprovide a final design that can be implemented as a relational database. They include tables that represent relationships\\nbetween entities, along with primary and foreign keys to maintain these relationships. Physical models also consider specific\\ndatabase management system (DBMS) features, such as performance tuning, managing, easy storing, and data retrieval.\\nData Modeling Process\\nData modeling is a method used to understand how data is processed and stored. It involves careful planning of how data will\\nbe represented and how it will meet business needs. Different data modeling techniques use specific symbols and layouts to\\nshow how data is structured. Let us understand the basic steps involved in the data modeling process with the help of the\\nsteps written below:\\nSearch\\nRecent Posts\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

Why is data modeling important?\\n8.2. What are the types of data models?\\n8.3. What tools are used for data modeling?\\n1. Identify Entities: The very first step of data modeling process is to start by identifying the key things, events, or\\nconcepts in the data set. These are called entities, and each one should be different from the others.\\n2. Identify Key Properties: As we have talked above that each entity in the data set must have unique characteristics\\nknown as attributes. Your main work in this step is to find those unique attributes for an entity. For example, a\\n‚Äúcustomer‚Äù entity may have attributes like first name, last name, and phone number, while an ‚Äúaddress‚Äù entity may\\ninclude a street name, city, and zip code.\\n3. Identify Relationships: In the next step, determine how these entities relate to each other. For example, a customer\\nmay have a permanent address and an order may be shipped to a different address labeled as ‚Äúoffice address‚Äù. These\\nrelationships are often shown using diagrams like Unified Modeling Language (UML).\\n4. Map Attributes: In this step, Your job is to make sure that all attributes are properly connected to their entities. This\\nstep ensures that the data model accurately represents how the business will use the data. Various patterns can be\\nused for this purpose depending on the needs of the business.\\n5. Assign Keys and Normalize Data: In this step, you will assign unique identifiers, or keys, to link related data without\\nduplicating information. This step, known as normalization will help in reducing the storage space but may affect how\\nquickly the data can be accessed.\\n6. Finalize and Validate: Finally, In the last step, review and refine the data model to make sure it meets business needs.\\nThis process should be repeated as there might be data that needs to be changed over time.\\nThis approach helps in creating a clear and organized structure for data, making it easier to manage and use.\\nTypes Of Data Modeling\\nIn today‚Äôs time, Data modeling has evolved a lot with database systems. With the passage of time, it has become more\\ncomplex as data storage needs have grown. Here are some of the common types of data models that are widely used by\\ncompanies to fulfill their needs and demands:\\n1. Hierarchical data models organize data in a tree-like structure, showing one-to-many relationships. Each record has a\\nsingle root or parent that connects to one or more child tables. This model was first used in the IBM Information\\nManagement System (IMS) in 1966, especially in banking.\\xa0\\nWhile it is less efficient as compared to newer models, it is still used in systems like Extensible Markup Language (XML) and\\ngeographic information systems (GIS).\\n2. Relational data models were introduced by IBM researcher E.F. Codd in 1970 and are still widely used today. They\\norganize data in tables where data segments are joined, making database management simpler.\\xa0Relational databases often\\nuse structured query language (SQL) to manage data. These databases are effective at maintaining data accuracy and\\nreducing redundancy, making them ideal for transaction processing system.\\n3. Entity-relationship (ER) data models basically use diagrams to show the relationships between entities in a database. Data\\narchitects use ER modeling tools to create visual maps that help in designing databases.\\n4. Object-oriented data models became popular in the mid-1990s with the rise of object-oriented programming. In these\\nmodels, ‚Äúobjects‚Äù represent real-world entities which are grouped into class hierarchies with associated features. Object-\\noriented databases can handle complex data relationships and are used in multimedia, hypertext databases, and other\\nadvanced applications.\\n5. Dimensional data models were developed by Ralph Kimball to speed up data retrieval in data warehouses. Unlike\\nrelational and ER models, which focus on efficient storage, dimensional models prioritize quick access to information, even if\\nit promotes redundancy. These models are commonly used in online analytical processing (OLAP) systems.\\nAdvantages Of Data Modeling\\xa0\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\nData modeling is a key part of building software or database systems. It offers several benefits and features which include:\\n1. Better Understanding of Data: Data modeling shows how data is organized and connected, which helps people in\\nmaking better decisions about how to use and store it.\\n2. Better Data Quality: By finding mistakes and inconsistencies in data, data modeling improves the overall quality of the\\ndata and prevents issues.\\n3. Better Collaboration: It helps everyone involved in the development process to communicate more effectively,\\nleading to better decisions and outcomes.\\n4.

An Introductory Dive into the\\nConcept\\nTo kick the discussion on data lake vs. data warehouse, we need to ask: What is a Data Lake? A data lake is like an enormous\\nbody of raw data that can hold everything ‚Äì structured, unstructured, or semi-structured. Whether it be a CSV file, an app log,\\nor a video clip, it‚Äôs all in a data lake. There is no requirement for upfront organization. Store it first; for structure, do it later\\nwhen you need to analyze the data. It‚Äôs definitely flexible and thus becomes the sophistication of data scientists and\\nengineers.\\nData Lake Advantages: Reasons You Need Them\\nThe discussion about Data Lake vs Data Warehouse would not be complete without the mentioning of the fact that,\\nincreasingly, everyone seems to be talking more about data lakes.\\xa0\\nBelow are important Data Lake Benefits:\\nFlexibility\\nThere is no restriction on the types of data that can be stored; no pre-formatting before storing is needed.\\nCost-effective\\nStorage costs are generally low with such types of systems, especially in a cloud environment.\\nReal-Time Data Ingestion\\nExcellent for most applications for big data analysis.\\nSupports Advanced Analytics\\nConsidered as one of the best solutions for machine learning, AI, and predictive modeling applications.\\nBig data would be a world that sees data lakes as an open modern solution that can scale.\\nData Warehouse Definition: The Candor Powerhouse of\\nData Storage\\nMoving on with our data lake vs. data warehouse comparison, now let‚Äôs discuss the data warehouse definition. Data\\nwarehouses are basically systems for storage in this structure, where the data has already been transformed and organized\\nwhen it gets into the store. This means that when data gets to the warehouse, it will have followed a schema; that is, it will\\nhave been formatted before it was stored. Most often, businesses will use data warehouses in business reporting,\\ndashboards, and routine analytics. It is best to use them when reliable and consistent data is needed for decision-making.\\nData Warehouse Benefit: Why Companies are Still Using\\nThem\\nAlthough data lake usage is the trend now, it is also true that a lot of organizations still invest heavily in building and\\nmaintaining data warehouses. Why? Because of these Data Warehouse Benefits:\\nVery well organized: Clean, structured, and formatted data is queried easily.\\nPerformance: Optimized for very complex queries and reporting.\\nSecurity and governance: Applying strict controls over data is more accessible.\\nReliable for business intelligence: It‚Äôs mainly for routine reporting and KPIs.\\xa0\\nIn the data lake vs. data warehouse argument, this classic system is still the trusted choice for businesses requiring accuracy\\nand compliance.\\nKey Differences: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse\\nThere is more to the real difference between data lake vs. data warehouse:\\xa0\\nA data lake accepts all types of input (structured/unstructured), while a warehouse needs to have a clean input\\nstructure.\\nCosts of storage: Storing large amounts in a data lake will usually be much cheaper, while warehouses can be even\\nmore expensive on account of their processing needs.\\nUsers: More attractive to the data scientists, while analysts and business users will probably use the warehouse.\\nUse Case: Use data lakes for predictive analysis, while data warehouses serve more for historical reporting.\\xa0\\nData Processing: Process after storage in a lake. In a warehouse, data is processed before storage.\\nThis is a clear comparison of data lake vs. data warehouse, and understanding the two would enable us to find out which\\nwould be fitting for various needs.\\nUse Cases: When Data Lake vs Data Warehouse Should\\nBe Used\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

The answer is simple: that would\\ndepend on your goals.\\nChoose Data Lake when dealing with large amounts of various formed data types like social media, video, or sensor\\ninformation.\\nData Warehouse should be adopted for structured reports and dashboard insights with standardized forms of data.\\nIn most modern companies, both are applied simultaneously.\\nUnderstanding data lake vs. data warehouse is not just about choosing sides but rather knowing how to use both wisely.\\nReal-Life Examples: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse in\\nAction\\nIs the real-world dynamic unclear? Here is how the big boys have got it going:\\nData lakes store user logs, viewing behaviors, and clickstreams by Netflix for deeper insights and AI modelling.\\nAmazon uses Data Warehouse for inventory tracking, sales report generation, as well as business KPIs monitoring.\\nThese real-life scenarios show that these two components work in tandem in the synergistic support of different functions.\\nIntegration and Modern Stack: Merging Data Lake and\\nData Warehouse\\xa0\\nThe modern world has started with the blurring between Data Lake vs Data Warehouse. The architectures of lakehouse, for\\ninstance, offer the best of both worlds-the flexibility of data lakes with the structure of data warehouses. Databricks and\\nSnowflake, among others, make it possible to store any type of data while enabling real-time analysis.\\xa0\\nSuch separation indicates that the understanding Data Lake vs Data Warehouse will help professionals in a solid design for\\nthe data infrastructure.\\xa0\\nLearning Curve: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse\\xa0\\nHowever, when you are starting your journey with data, the distinction between Data Lake vs Data Warehouse can make a\\ntremendous difference regarding making your career obstacle-free. Students can learn using cloud platforms like AWS,\\nAzure, or Google Cloud to build data lakes. Professionals can dedicate time and effort to learning tools such as SQL, ETL, or BI\\ndashboards and have a deeper knowledge of warehouses. These concepts are also very much at the center of courses in data\\nscience and analytics.\\xa0\\nUnderstanding What is a Data Lake, Data Lake Benefits, and Data Warehouse Definition can be your stepping stone towards\\na future-proof career.\\nKeep Learning with PW Skills\\nWant to master real-world data skills?

Consider an actual pipeline bringing water from a\\nreservoir to your home. The water in the pipeline is just like the data- something is always moving from the start to its\\ndestination. The pipeline refers to a sequence of steps put into place to manipulate data, starting from the collection stage\\nand enduringly finishing with either storage or analytic applications afore detailed in the process of finding information. ETL-\\nExtract, Transform, Load-finds its way as applicable names for them. The aim of data processes like this is to make data flow\\nwithout any lags and to make it available instantly or on a delayed schedule for actions associated with business intelligence,\\nreporting, or machine learning.\\xa0\\nImportance of Data Pipelines in Modern Workflows\\nData pipelines are a crucial thing in business life. Business organizations generate a lot of data right from customer\\ninteractions and social media posts to IoT sensors and financial transactions, every second. Managing data and analysis in a\\nmanual manner is close to impossible. That‚Äôs precisely when data pipelines became a must-have. For your company, data\\npipelines are keys for laying down the whole infrastructure to become data-driven. Once operational, they take out\\nduplications, decrease human error, and assure that the right data is delivered to the correct recipient at the right point in\\ntime.\\nHow to Build a Data Pipeline\\nThey now have concordance on what data pipelines are and how vital a function they provide; hence, it is imperative to now\\nmove to construct a data pipeline. The process takes hold; it needs a lot of substantial groundwork: foul and drainage,\\nbricklayers, roofing, and so forth. Once the first few contracts have taken place with the pipe sealer and the rest, the workers\\nput a bend in the pipe, letting extra curing of the joint. Santiago, in the meantime, still thinks about Manolin. He does not have\\nto think about the fish.\\nParts Of Data Pipelines\\nThere are several types of data pipelines; knowledge of these becomes really important while choosing one for your specific\\nuse case. One of the most common types is the batch data pipeline that processes data in chunks at scheduled intervals,\\nmaking it perfect for long-running processes with logs or daily sales reports. The other kind is the real-time or streaming data\\npipeline, which is made for scenarios where data processing cannot wait for any time. Useful for online shopping fraud\\ndetection and live dashboards. Hybrid combinations of real-time and batch are designed to give more flexibility. Cloud-native\\npipelines have been given more recognition these days, enabling scalability with less maintenance. Choice of type of data\\npipeline should be guided by factors like data volume, processing requirements, and business objectives.\\xa0\\n\\xa0Join Our Data Science Telegram Channel\\n Join Our Data Science WhatsApp Channel\\nArticles in the Data Application Kit\\nIn particular, the components that need to be incorporated into data pipelines. The first component and probably the most\\nimportant is the source bringing the raw data towards the pipeline systems. These sources could be internal databases, third-\\nparty APIs, or IoT middleware. The ingestion layer transports the data inside the system by pulling it, taking advantage of\\ntools such as Apache NiFi or Kafka. This is followed by the processing layer that ensures data transformation takes place\\nusing Apache Spark as a framework or just a set of SQL scripts. The storage layer stores the refined data and uses data lakes\\nalong with data warehouses. Finally, the orchestration layer coordinates all components effectively by implementing\\norchestration of components using software such as Apache Airflow or AWS Step Functions. Each of these components has a\\nnecessary role to play in making sure that data operates smoothly.\\nProblems in Building and Maintaining Data Pipelines\\nThe advantages of data pipelines are many; the problems with them are few. The biggest issue here is data quality. If\\ninconsistent or corrupt, the source data will have its errors reflected downstream through the pipeline. Latencies can be a\\nchallenge, especially for real-time pipelines, where time counts in milliseconds. Then there are scalability and cost\\nconsiderations as the data volumes grow. Maintenance is a continuous exercise of monitoring, error checking, and modifying\\nthe pipeline to accommodate new data sources or formats. All these concerns notwithstanding, the benefits of a well-\\ndesigned data pipeline outweigh the drawbacks, especially from the perspective of business alignment.\\xa0\\nSafety and Compliance of Data Pipelines\\nData safety and compliance became central in designing data pipelines when hacking sites and regulatory regime became the\\norder of the day. Organizations must make sure that data is encrypted in transit and on the location of sensitive information\\nlike personal details and items coming close to financial records. Such access control mechanisms must zero in on authorized\\nindividuals who can have access to and manipulate data. On top of this set of frameworks of compliance, such as GDPR and\\nHIPAA, must also be part of the old design standards of a pipeline. If it does not pass this plan, it could get stuck on the legal\\nside and damage its name in the long run. Building a solid data pipeline should consist of legislative trial records, anomaly\\ndetection systems as well as ongoing compliance checks that submit the essence of trustworthiness and legal integrity.\\xa0\\nReal-Life Use Cases of Data Pipelines\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

These very real implementations show how wide-\\nranging, and even more importantly, how very transformational data pipelines can be across sectors, thus giving credence to\\ntheir worth of transforming raw data into actionable business insights.\\xa0\\nFuture Trends in Data Pipelines\\nThe data pipelines arena is quickly evolving with advancements in AI, cloud computing, and big data. One main trend is to\\nmove toward serverless data pipelines with complete infrastructure management by cloud providers, leaving teams to\\nconcentrate solely on data logic. Machine learning is further being embedded in pipelines for automated data quality checks\\nand anomaly detection. DataOps-a new approach that combines DevOps principles with data engineering-is gaining traction\\nas a means to establish better pipeline reliability and team collaboration. Another exciting trend is low-code or no-code\\npipeline tools, allowing users who are not engineers to build and manage data pipelines efficiently. For anyone engaged in\\ndata engineering or analytics, keeping track of these trends is an absolute must.\\nAlso Read:\\n1. Data Farming Explained: 5 Modern Methods, Future Opportunities\\n2.

The main difference is that Data Mining extracts insights from existing data, whereas Data\\nFarming is concerned with the creation of synthetic or simulated data to model real-world scenarios.\\xa0\\nThe figure of Data Farming was born through military and scientific research but has jetted off into several other sectors,\\nincluding finance, health care, and AI development. Synthetic data allows organizations to test hypotheses, predict trends,\\nand optimize systems without being constrained to purely historical data. This makes Data Farming attractive when the\\nretrieval of real-world data becomes scarce or prohibitively expensive.\\nWhen using Data Farming versus Data Mining, the prime distinction lies in the approach: Data Mining digs deep into existing\\ndatasets looking for patterns, while Data Farming grows new datasets to cater to a given need. Both have feet in analytics,\\nbut Data Farming bears unique advantages when it comes to predictive modeling and scenario testing.\\nData Farming Key Techniques in Today‚Äôs World\\nData Farming goes beyond just data collecting; it intelligently synthesizes, refines, and uses synthetic data sets to solve real-\\nworld problems. Unlike conventional data analysis, which has to work with historical data, Data Farming creates data from\\nsimulations, AI models, and computational techniques. Here are some of the most impactful processes in Data Farming in\\neffect today along with actual examples:\\n1. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM): The Simulation of Complex Systems\\nOne of the most powerful Data Farming techniques is Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), which encapsulates autonomous\\n‚Äúagents‚Äù (digital entities) interacting with one another in a simulated environment according to rules that have been\\npredefined for them; a form of collective behavior emerges from the combination of the actions of the agents in this system,\\nwhich generates huge amounts of data.\\nHow It Works:\\nAgents can stand for customers, vehicles, animals, or entire organizations.\\nThey interact with each other and their environment to create dynamic datasets.\\nResearchers tweak variable settings to observe different results.\\nPresent-Day Applications:\\nUrban Planning: Simulating the traffic flows to plan the best city built environment.\\nEconomics: The stock market behavior under various policies.\\nEpidemiology: Forecasting the diffusion of diseases and optimal response by public health.\\nThis is of extreme use in Data Farming because it allows the simulation of scenarios without real-world risk associated with it.\\nAn example is a retail company setting up yet a new store layout and simulating how customers would have behaved.\\n2. Monte Carlo Simulations: Welcoming Randomness into Predictions\\nMonte Carlo Simulation is another major pillar of Data Farming, using Monte Carlo random sampling to estimate\\nprobabilities and describe uncertainties. Named after the well-known casino in Monaco, this method runs very often\\n(thousands or millions) iterations to derive a predictive picture of possible outcomes.\\nHow It Works:\\nCubicle input variables are assigned a certain probability distribution (for example, ‚ÄúWhat if sales go between 5 and 20\\npercent?‚Äù).\\nWithin the given intervals, the system creates random values and produces results.\\nAfter thousands of runs, it makes possible a statistical distribution of results.\\nReal-World Applications:\\nFinance: Investment risk and portfolio performance evaluation.\\nEngineering: Study on durability of product under stress conditions.\\nHealthcare: Estimate average success rates of new therapies.\\nMonte Carlo Simulation makes Data Farming very much effective for risk analysis. For example, an insurance company could\\npredict claim probabilities for different disaster scenarios.\\n3. Synthetic Data Generation: Datasets of AI\\xa0\\nArtificially constructed data has become a game-changer in Data Farming, as privacy laws like GDPR severely restrict the use\\nof actual data. This involves the generation of artificial data using AI (and especially via Generative Adversarial Networks, or\\nGANs) that appears to be derived from actual data.\\xa0\\nHow It Works:\\nAI models would learn the pattern of actual data and generate an entirely new data set but statistically similar.\\nWhat Does a Product Marketing Manager Do?\\n2025 Career Guide\\nA Product marketing manager is responsible\\nfor communicating about a specific product to\\npeople, getting them familiar about the\\nproduct value and usability.

A bank could\\ngenerate millions of synthetic transactions to test fraud detection systems‚Äîwithout putting real customer data at risk.\\xa0\\n4. Scenario Testing & Digital Twins: VIRTUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF REAL SYSTEMS\\xa0\\nScenario testing through digital twins is the newest and cream of the crop in Data Farming. This is by far one of the latest\\nways to do Data Farming via scenario testing using digital twins, which are virtual representations of physical systems that\\nare updated in real time. Using this ‚Äútwins,‚Äù companies can play with different strategies before they actually implement\\nthem.\\xa0\\nHow It Works:\\xa0\\nA digital twin, created with such a level of live data input, is a simulation of a real-world system (e.g. factory, supply\\nchain, or even a city).\\xa0\\nCompanies then run ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios (i.e., ‚ÄúWhat if we double demand?‚Äù) to see what potential impacts may be.\\xa0\\nFilling the model with real-time data from IoT sensors creates robustness for accuracy.\\xa0\\nReal-World Applications:\\xa0\\nManufacturing: Virtualizing a series of changes in production lines to optimize their configuration.\\xa0\\nSmart Cities: Simulating traffic, energy consumption, and emergency responses.\\xa0\\nAerospace: Predicting the need for maintenance of aircraft before failures occur.\\xa0\\nDigital twins take Data Farming to the next level by fusing real-world data and predictive simulations. For example, an airline\\ncould use a digital twin to test fuel efficiency strategies before implementing them fleet-wide.\\xa0\\n5. Evolutionary Algorithms: Data Optimization through AI ‚ÄúNatural Selection‚Äù\\xa0\\nEvolutionary algorithms are inspired by Darwin‚Äôs principle of evolution; it is one technique of Data Farming in which solutions\\nare ‚Äúevolved‚Äù over generations with AI. Depending on the rules of mutation and combining data models, the algorithms were\\nfound best for producing the best ideal outcome.\\xa0\\nHow It Works:\\xa0\\nStart with a population of random solutions.\\xa0\\n‚ÄúMutations‚Äù and ‚Äúcrossbreeds‚Äù them.\\xa0\\nOnly the best performing models survive and reproduce.\\xa0\\nRepeat until an optimal solution emerges.\\xa0\\nReal-World Applications:\\xa0\\nLogistics: Finding the most efficient delivery routes.\\xa0\\nDrug Discovery: Simulating chemical compounds to identify potential medicines.\\xa0\\nGame AI: Developing NPC behaviors that are smarter by using simulated evolution.\\xa0\\nEvolutionary algorithms make Data Farming very elastic. For instance, a delivery logistics company can adopt this method in\\nestablishing the optimal delivery routes within dynamically changing traffic conditions.\\nJoin our Data Science \\xa0Telegram channel for exclusive updates and tips!\\nWhich Data Farming Technique to Employ?\\nChoosing the right Data Farming technique is contingent upon the purpose:\\n1. Need to imitate the human? ‚Üí Agent-Based Modeling\\n2. Unsure of something? ‚Üí Monte Carlo Simulations\\n3. No real data? ‚Üí Synthetic Data Generation\\n4. Real-world systems tested? ‚Üí Digital Twins\\n5. Complex problems optimized? ‚Üí Evolutionary Algorithms\\nAs Data Farming keeps evolving, more hybrid techniques would be employed in the future-data harvesting using a\\ncombination of AI and IoTs and quantum computing.\\nData Farming vs Data Mining: What‚Äôs the Difference?\\nWhile both Data Farming and Data Mining deal with large datasets, their purposes and techniques are quite different\\nsubjects. Data Mining is an analysis query that leads into the finding of hidden patterns, correlations, trends, and so forth in\\nExplore Cyber Security Tutorial: Start Your\\nCareer in Cyber Safety (2025 Insights)\\nCyber Security Tutorial emphasizes the\\nimportance of safeguarding oneself in ‚Ä¶\\nRead More ¬ª\\nCategories\\nSelect Category\\npreexisting data. As if one were sifting through a gold mine, hunting down valuable nuggets.\\nData Farming: Beginning from the bottom up, Data Farming cannot rely on previous data but creates entirely new data sets\\nfrom simulation, AI models, and new synthetic data techniques. This makes Data Farming very applicable in scenarios such as\\nthe testing of autonomous vehicles, where real data tend to be severely limited or too dangerous to collect.\\nAnother difference lies in scalability. Data Mining is limited by the amount of available data in a raw form, while with Data\\nFarming, one can define any number of data sets using parameters. Though, of course, both actually complement each other-\\none gives the real data insights, and the other valuable experimental opportunities without real-world limitations.\\nContemporary Applications in Data Farming Across\\nIndustries\\xa0\\nData Farming has been changing the face of industries by empowering solutions without the geographical constraints of\\nconventional data collection process. For instance, researchers in health use Data Farming to simulate doses of potential\\ndrugs. State-of-the-art methods in disease spread simulation accelerate breakthroughs in medicine.\\nData Farming finds its place in risk assessment, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and much more in the financial field.\\nBanks, for example, will generate synthetic market data in order to test their trading strategies under different economic\\nconditions ‚Äì all without putting real capital at risk. Typical examples of the application of Data Farming include retail and e-\\ncommerce companies, which use the data as first steps in modeling customer behavior, attribute-based pricing optimization,\\nand demand forecasting.\\nIt is good for self-driving cars, as Data Farming is given importance in training purposes. There is a little way that can be done\\nby relying just on real-world test drives, which are tiresome and hazardous. So what these companies do is create the virtual\\nenvironments where millions of driving scenarios are captured.\\nThe Future of Data Farming: Emerging Opportunities\\nData Farming becomes the coveting tool with the advancement of AI and computing, and a major opportunity in that context\\nis in tie-up between AI training and reinforcement learning. Data generation through Data Farming would enable different\\ntraining datasets synthesis, which would improve accuracy and adaptability of models.\\nEnergy modeled by climate change and sustainability are other promising areas. By using Data Farming, scientists are able to\\nsimulate environmental alterations, predict occurrence of natural disasters, and test various green energy solutions. All these\\nwould provide a new approach to the tackle of climate challenges through data-driven policy recommendations.\\nThe new frontiers that Data Farming has opened will include the growing metaverse and virtual economies. As the expansion\\nof digital worlds continues, companies will require synthetic data to analyze virtual consumer behavior, build compellingly\\nimmersive experiences, and optimize digital marketplaces.\\xa0\\nChallenges and Ethical Considerations in Data Farming\\xa0\\nData Farming has its own challenges that hinder the tremendous promised advantage it would bring about. Data accuracy is\\none challenge. Since synthetic data are generated artificially, its realism and reliability are made prerequisites. Poor Data\\nFarming models lead to biased or misleading results and thus having a severe impact in making decisions.\\nMoreover, privacy comes to play. Although Data Farming does not require much personal data, its misuse of synthetic\\ndatasets may still pose ethical issues. Regulations such as GDPR will need to adapt to the new facets brought about by Data\\nFarming, as well as proper usage of Data Farming to be achieved.\\nAlso, large-scale Data Farming can incur high computational costs. Organizations must weigh the costs of generating and\\nprocessing synthetic data against the possible advantages that could accrue if that data were produced or purchased.\\nHow to Get Started with Data Farming\\xa0\\nFor both students and professionals, Data Farming will definitely be learning a simulation tool like AnyLogic, MATLAB, or any\\nof the frameworks based on Python. Added to the learning mix will be statistical modeling, AI, and machine learning.\\nMany universities and online platforms offer courses on Data Farming, agent-based modeling, and generation of synthetic\\ndata. Hands-on projects can produce practical experience, such as creating simulated market data or training AI with\\nsynthetic datasets.\\xa0\\nCompanies looking into Data Farming should start with pilot projects, testing smaller-scale simulations prior to full-scale\\ninstallation. Data science experts could also be brought on board to optimally tailor their Data Farming strategies for just\\nsuch industry needs.\\xa0\\nWhy Data Farming Is the Future of Data Science ?\\nData Farming is much more than a keyword: it is a game-changing method in generating data in parallel to at-the-place\\nmethods such as Data Mining. Data Farming, through enabling the construction of scalable, customizable datasets,\\nempowers industries to innovate, predict, and optimize like never before.\\xa0\\nAs virtual worlds, big data, and AI grow and develop, the role of Data Farming will pave the way for a much brighter future.\\nToday, a student, a researcher, or a business leader preparing themselves to understand Data Farming is definitely preparing\\nhimself or herself for the data-driven opportunities of tomorrow.\\xa0\\nAlso Read:\\n1.

Understand Your Target Audience\\nIdentify where your audience spends time online. Use tools like Google Analytics and social listening to find out which\\nplatforms are most popular with your target group. For example, TikTok is great for reaching Gen Z, while Facebook appeals\\nto a broader age range.\\n3. Assess Your Content Capabilities\\nThink about the type of content you can create.

Tools like BuzzSumo or Brandwatch\\ncan help you see which platforms are driving the most engagement for others in your industry.\\n5.

The following are some content\\ntypes to consider:\\nShort-Form Videos (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts): Great for quick tutorials, product teasers, and trends.\\nThey‚Äôre mobile-friendly and drive high engagement.\\nImages & Carousels (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn): Ideal for product shots, infographics, and quotes. They‚Äôre easy to\\nconsume and visually appealing.\\nEducational Content (LinkedIn, YouTube, Threads): Useful for sharing tips, guides, and industry insights. Helps build\\nauthority and trust with your audience.\\nPolls & Quizzes (Instagram Stories, LinkedIn, X): Encourages interaction and feedback, boosting visibility and\\nengagement.\\nUser-Generated Content (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook): Customer reviews and testimonials build trust and show\\nreal-life experiences.\\nText-Based Posts (LinkedIn, Threads, X): Perfect for sharing news, thoughts, and updates, sparking discussions and\\nshowcasing expertise.\\nLong-Form Videos (YouTube, LinkedIn): Best for in-depth content like webinars and tutorials, offering value and\\nengagement.\\nBy matching content types with platforms, you can maximize your reach and connect better with your audience.\\nObjectives of a Social Media Strategy\\nA social media strategy should have clear goals to align with your business targets.

What are the Scrum events?\\nWhat Is Scrum Methodology?\\nScrum is an efficient method or framework used to develop, deliver and maintain complex\\nproducts and that too especially in software development. Sprints in Scrum methodology such\\nas teamwork, accountability and step by step progress in a structured cycle known as ‚ÄúSprint‚Äù.\\nScrum allows teams to be more flexible, collaborate and focused on delivering value in faster\\ndeadlines. This framework proves to be the best in fast changing environments.\\xa0\\nRead More:\\xa0The Ultimate Guide to Agile Product Management\\nFeatures of Scrum Methodology\\nScrum methodology has a number of features, some of them are listed below.\\nScrum organises all major work into short cycles also known as Scrum. It takes only 2-4\\nweeks. Each Spring is responsible to deliver a small usable part of the product.\\nScrum has three main roles i,e. Product owner, Scrum master, Development Team\\nThe product Backlog is set on priority in Scrum methodology. The Product Owner\\nmanages and updates the backlog regularly.\\nEach day there is a quick meeting to get updated on whatever is being done a day\\nbefore.\\nSpring planning is done before each sprint while the sprint review at the end of the day\\ntakes notes whether or not the planned sprint is completed.\\nScrum delivers small usable parts daily i,e. Incremental progress. This reduces the risk\\nof\\xa0 failure by a significant amount.\\nScrum exhibits flexibility and adaptability. With feedback being one of the important\\nparts, adaptation to changes becomes easy.\\nScrum ensures that the most important features are prioritised earlier\\xa0 i,e. Customer\\npriorities.\\nWhat Problem Does Scrum Solve?\\nScrum plays a very significant role in managing complex and fast paced projects especially in\\nsoftware and product development. Well when it comes to the point that Scrum solves in\\nproduct development life cycle, then check a quick check. Traditional project management\\nmethods face a major setback in the following given below.\\nChanging requirements frequently becomes a tedious task with traditional project\\nmanagement.\\nWhen projects are large it becomes tedious to handle the problem.\\nTeams often work in silos and in poor coordination\\xa0\\nThere is often a huge delay in the delivery of the final product to the customers.\\nWhat Changes with Scrum?\\nScrum helps teams build better products faster by staying adaptable, flexible and focused.\\xa0\\nWith Scrum the entire product development cycle is broken into small and manageable\\nchunks i,e. Sprints\\nRegular collaborations and communication is given more priority\\nChanges at any point during development are quick based on users feedback.\\nFinal product delivery is often on time or sometimes before too.\\nScrum Artifacts: An Overview\\nScrum artifacts are the key tools that help teams manage work and track progress throughout\\nthe development journey of the scrum project. Check the three important Scrum artefacts\\nbelow.\\n1. Product Backlog\\nThe product backlog in Scrum is everything which needs to be fixed, such as features, fixes,\\ntechnical tasks, and ideas. These product backlogs are generally provided using feedback\\nfrom users.\\xa0This is prioritised by the product owner. These product backlogs keep on changing\\nwith time and the product team keeps checking on these backlogs in each round.\\xa0\\nProduct owner is responsible for creating, managing and prioritising the backlog.\\nIt is basically dynamic as it changes based on the market needs and trends.\\nIt is regularly refined on a continuous basis with the product owner and team\\ncollaborating to update all details including the estimate and prioritization based on\\nproduct value.\\n2. Sprint Backlog\\nThe Spring backlog consists of a list of tasks from users basically selected from the product\\nbacklogs which are to be completed in the current sprint. It breaks down each task into\\nactionable items and helps the team stay focused and organized during that Sprint.\\nSprint backlog are commitments teams take to complete in the current sprint.\\xa0\\nSprint is basically a subset of product backlog items that teams commit to implement in\\none sprint cycle.\\xa0\\nComplete focus is on how the team works on the deliverable in one sprint.\\n3. Increment\\nAn increment is the stage or working piece of the product delivered at the end of a sprint. It\\nincludes that all the items from the sprint must meet the quality standards and with each\\nincrement product moves one step closer to completion.\\nIt is the work delivered at every sprint.\\nIncrement is a sum of all capabilities delivered which was delivered in the previous\\nsprint completely as a part of the PI.\\xa0\\nAt the end of each sprint, the product owner gets to decide whether to release the\\nincrement or wait until the next release.\\xa0\\nWhat are Scrum Roles?\\nScrum defines three basic roles to form a complete cross functional team with each role\\nhaving the responsibility of ensuring smooth project run and value to the customers.\\n1. Product Owner\\nThe product owner is the main responsible person who defines and prioritises whatever the\\nteam needs to build. They are responsible for managing the product backlog making sure that\\nit is clear, current and perfectly aligned with the customer needs and the goals of the\\nbusiness.\\xa0\\nThey act as the representor of customers making sure that the team works on the most\\nvaluable features based on customers needs and preferences. Product owners tend to\\nmaximize the product value by deciding the workflow of the product.\\nAct as a guide who tells the team on which features to deliver next\\nThey bridge the gap between whatever it is that the business wants and the\\nunderstanding on the team sides.\\nThey decide when and how frequent releases can take place.\\n2. Scrum Master (Leader)\\nThe Scrum Master is the coach personnel in the product development journey or say scrum\\nmethodology. Scrum master is basically the guardian of the team looking out for everyone and\\nmaking sure that everyone follows the scrum principles and removing any bottlenecks which\\nslow down the product progress.\\xa0\\nThe scrum master provides support to both development teams as well as the product owners\\nbut is not directly managing the team. They just help the team stay productive and remove\\nblocks (if any)\\nThey schedule the resources required for each sprint\\nThey also facilitate various sprint events and meeting with the teams\\nThey facilitate any kind of team training required while adopting new practices or\\ntechnology\\n3. Development Team\\nThe Development team consists of a group of professionals who are responsible for designing,\\ntesting, building and delivering the product. They are the professionals who actually work on\\nthe product with all the technical and other skills required to complete it on time.\\xa0\\nThe development team decides how to get the work done i,e. The workflow in each sprint. All\\nthey need to do is to deliver a usable product increment at the end of each sprint.\\nThey work in collaboration to ensure successful sprint completion\\nThey implement sustainable development practices.\\xa0\\nThey also plan and estimate the work they can complete in each sprint.\\nRead More:\\xa0Top 3 Freelance Sites For Web Developers Web Developers In India: Get A\\nChance To Earn ‚Çπ1L+/Month\\nWhat are Scrum Events?\\nScrum events are structured or planned meetings which bring complete transparency and\\ndecide the workflow of each sprint in the scrum process. Every Scrum event has its own\\npurpose to help the team deliver an efficient end product at the end.\\n1. Sprint Planning\\nThis scrum event is concerned with the team estimating the work or tasks to be completed in\\nthe next sprint. The team members define the sprint goals, measurable, and more.\\xa0\\nAt the end of the planning every team member has a clear idea of how each increment can be\\ndelivered in the sprint. The product owner presents the high priority items from the product\\nbacklog and team selects what they can commit for the next sprint.\\n2. Sprint\\nSprint is the time period or core cycle of scrum which usually takes around 2 to 4 weeks long\\nduring which a small portion of the product is designed, developed and delivered. The\\nduration of the sprint clearly depends on the complexity of the work.\\n3. Daily Scrum (Stand Up)\\nThe daily scrum is a short or 15 minutes daily meeting where the development team gets to\\ndiscuss their deliverables yesterday and what they will be doing today. They also notify the\\nblockers in the process (if any). This helps everyone stay on the same page and focus on the\\nsprint goal as a whole.\\n4. Sprint Review\\nAt the end of each sprint the team needs to take a walk through the tasks completed in the\\nsprint. A complete feedback is collected and the product backlog might be updated based on\\nthe customer needs. The major goal of this scrum event is to count progress and collect\\nfeedback to improve the product.\\n5. Sprint Retrospective\\nIn this stage the team comes together to discuss what worked and what needs to be improved\\nincluding the things that didn‚Äôt work in favor during the sprint. Ideas collected from the team\\nto improve the upcoming sprints.\\nAlso Read:\\n1. Product Specs | Definition and Overview\\n2. What is Product Pricing? Objectives, Types, and Factors\\n3.

Why is data mining important?\\n5.4. Q4. What are data mining tools?\\n\\nWhat is Data Mining?\\n\\nData mining is a multi-step process of extracting knowledge from large datasets or databases. The data collected is passed\\nthrough a series of steps including data preprocessing, data transformation, data mining, pattern evaluation, knowledge\\n\\nrepresentation, knowledge refinement, etc.\\n\\n \\n\\nData mining is used to evaluate patterns and uncover hidden trends for businesses. It also helps in fraud detection,\\n\\nmarketing, customer behavior patterns, and more. Social media also uses data mining to select the products in trending.\\n\\nAlso, check What is Data Visualization and its uses?\\n\\nData Mining Techniques\\n\\nData mining uses various techniques and algorithms to convert a large amount of data into an organized format and\\n\\nanalyse them for output.\\n\\n1. Association Rules\\n\\nThe association rule is used to discover relationships between variables based on market analysis in large datasets. It\\ngenerally connects frequent item sets and generates rules to find connections between them. Common algorithms used\\n\\nwith this technique are the Apriori algorithm, the Eclat algorithm, FP-growth, etc.\\n\\nFor example, to determine a company‚Äôs performance, association rules will collect various information and determine\\n\\nfactors to determine its performance and forecast.\\nUses\\n\\n¬¢ Market based analysis\\ne Recommendation system\\n\\ne Analyse user navigation patterns on websites.\\n\\n2. Classification\\n\\n83.\\n\\nClassification is a supervised learning technique used to predict and observations based on old data. A large labeled\\ndataset is trained to create a discrete outcome variable. This technique is used to underlying data in a more organised\\n\\nmanner.\\n\\nSome of the common algorithms used in classification are K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic regression, Decision trees,\\n\\nSupport Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, etc.\\nUses\\n\\n¬¢ Itcan be used as a spad detector.\\ne Used to categorise customers based on their purchasing patterns and behaviour.\\n\\n¬¢ Predicting disease based on the patient data\\n\\n3. Regression\\n\\n \\n\\nRegression is a supervised learning technique used to predict continuous numerical value based on the input variables. It\\n\\nis used to establish relationships among variables.\\n\\nSome of the common algorithms used in these data mining techniques are linear regression, support vector regression,\\n\\ndecision trees, random forest, polynomial regression, etc.\\nUses\\n\\ne Itcan be used in house price prediction\\n¬¢ Sales forecasting based on historical data\\n¬¢ Stock Market analysis\\n\\n¬¢ Future predictions of stock prices\\n\\n4. Clustering\\n\\n \\n\\nClustering is a data mining technique used to find relationships or connections between objects. It is similar to\\nclassification where objects are labeled and categorized for further analysis. It is an unsupervised learning technique used\\n\\nto group similar data points together based on their similar features without predefined labels.\\nUses\\n\\n¬© Group customers with similar behaviours\\n¬¢ Image divisions into meaningful segments.\\n\\n¬¢ Identify anomalies in data.\\n\\n5. Decision Trees\\n\\n \\n\\nDecision trees are used to predict an outcome based on a set of given criteria. It comprises root, leaf nodes and internal\\nnodes. It is used for classifications as well as regression tasks. It applies a greedy search using divide and conquer\\n\\napproach. It helps in selecting a specific direction in a vast sea of data.\\n\\nUses\\n\\nIt is used in healthcare to diagnose symptoms based on patient data.\\nIt is used in finance to calculate credit scoring and loan approval\\n\\nIt is also used in customer segmentation and targeting\\n\\n¬¢ It is used in quality control and defect detection\\n\\n¬¢ Inventory management and sales forecasting\\n\\n6. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\\n\\n \\n\\nKNN is one of the most popular supervised machine learning algorithms. It uses proximity relations to make classifications\\nor predictions. It assumes the similarity between the new data and available data in almost similar categories.

However, logic programming systems have a logical interpretation,\\nwhereas production systems do not.\\n\\nContents Vv\\n\\n \\n\\n‚Äú Production system rules ce\\n\\nA classic example of a production rule-based system is the domain-specific expert system that uses rules to make\\ndeductions or choices.!] For example, an expert system might help a doctor choose the correct diagnosis based on\\na cluster of symptoms, or select tactical moves to play a game.\\n\\nRule-based systems can be used to perform lexical analysis to compile or interpret computer programs, or in\\n\\nnatural language processing 2]\\n\\nRule-based programming attempts to derive execution instructions from a starting set of data and rules. This is a\\nmore indirect method than that employed by an imperative programming language, which lists execution steps\\nsequentially.\\n\\nConstruction oe\\n\\nA typical rule-based system has four basic components:4)\\n¬´ A list of rules or rule base, which is a specific type of knowledge base.\\n\\n¬´ An inference engine or semantic reasoner, which infers information or takes action based on the interaction of\\ninput and the rule base. The interpreter executes a production system program by performing the following\\nmatch-resolve-act cycle!)\\n\\n¬´ Match: In this first phase, the condition sides of all productions are matched against the contents of working\\nmemory. As a result a set (the conflict set) is obtained, which consists of instantiations of all satisfied\\nproductions. An instantiation of a production is an ordered list of working memory elements that satisfies the\\n\\ncondition side of the production.\\n¬´ Conflict-resolution: In this second phase, one of the production instantiations in the conflict set is chosen for\\n\\nexecution. If no productions are satisfied, the interpreter halts.\\n\\n¬´ Act: In this third phase, the actions of the production selected in the conflict-resolution phase are executed\\nThese actions may change the contents of working memory. At the end of this phase, execution returns to the\\nfirst phase.\\n\\n¬´ Temporary working memory, which is a database of facts.\\n\\n¬´ Auser interface or other connection to the outside world through which input and output signals are received and\\nsent.\\n\\nWhereas the matching phase of the inference engine has a logical interpretation, the conflict resolution and action\\nphases do not. Instead, \"their semantics is usually described as a series of applications of various state-changing\\noperators, which often gets quite involved (depending on the choices made in deciding which ECA rules fire, when,\\nand so forth), and they can hardly be regarded as declarative\", 1]\\n\\n‚Äú Logic programming rules ce\\n\\nThe logic programming family of computer systems includes the programming language Prolog, the database\\nlanguage Datalog and the knowledge representation and problem-solving language Answer Set Programming\\n(ASP). In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:\\n\\nA :- By, ..., Bye\\nand are read as declarative sentences in logical form:\\n\\nA if B, and ... and B,.\\nIn the simplest case of Horn clauses (or \"definite\" clauses), which are a subset of first-order logic, all of the A, Bj, ...,\\n\\nB, are atomic formulae.\\n\\nAlthough Horn clause logic programs are Turing complete &ll7] for many practical applications, it is useful to extend\\nHorn clause programs by allowing negative conditions, implemented by negation as failure. Such extended logic\\nprograms have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\\n\\ns Differences and relationships between production rules and logic\\nprogramming rules\\n\\n.\\n\\nThe most obvious difference between the two kinds of systems is that production rules are typically written in the\\nforward direction, ifA then B, and logic programming rules are typically written in the backward direction, B if A. In\\nthe case of logic programming rules, this difference is superficial and purely syntactic. It does not affect the\\nsemantics of the rules. Nor does it affect whether the rules are used to reason backwards, Prolog style, to reduce\\nthe goal Bto the subgoals A, or whether they are used, Datalog style, to derive B from A.\\n\\nIn the case of production rules, the forward direction of the syntax reflects the stimulus-response character of most\\nproduction rules, with the stimulus A coming before the response B. Moreover, even in cases when the response is\\nsimply to draw a conclusion B from an assumption A, as in modus ponens, the match-resolve-act cycle is restricted\\nto reasoning forwards from A to B. Reasoning backwards in a production system would require the use of an\\nentirely different kind of inference engine.\\n\\nIn his Introduction to Cognitive Science,¬Æl Paul Thagard includes logic and rules as alternative approaches to\\nmodelling human thinking. He does not consider logic programs in general, but he considers Prolog to be, not a\\nrule-based system, but \"a programming language that uses logic representations and deductive techniques\" (page\\n40).\\n\\nHe argues that rules, which have the form /F condition THEN action, are \"very similar\" to logical conditionals, but\\nthey are simpler and have greater psychological plausibility (page 51). Among other differences between logic and\\nrules, he argues that logic uses deduction, but rules use search (page 45) and can be used to reason either forward\\nor backward (page 47). Sentences in logic \"have to be interpreted as universally true‚Äô, but rules can be defaults,\\nwhich admit exceptions (page 44). He does not observe that all of these features of rules apply to logic\\nprogramming systems.\\n\\n~ See also ¬¢\\n\\nLogic programming\\n\\n¬´ Expert systems\\n\\nRewriting\\n\\ne RuleML\\n\\nList of rule-based languages\\n\\nLearning classifier system\\ne Rule-based machine learning\\n\\ne Rule-based modeling\\n\\n~ References ¬¢\\n\\n1.‚Äú Crina Grosan; Ajith Abraham (29 July 2011). /ntelligent Systems: A Modern Approachl.

It\\nproceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item\\nsets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by\\nApriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has\\napplications in domains such as market basket analysis.\\n\\n \\n\\nContents A\\nOverview\\n\\nExamples\\nExample 1\\n\\nExample 2\\nLimitations\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nA Overview &\\n\\nThe Apriori algorithm was proposed by Agrawal and Srikant in 1994. Apriori is designed to operate on databases\\ncontaining transactions (for example, collections of items bought by customers, or details of a website\\nfrequentation or IP addresses!2)), Other algorithms are designed for finding association rules in data having no\\ntransactions (Winepi and Minepi), or having no timestamps (DNA sequencing). Each transaction is seen as a set of\\nitems (an itemse?). Given a threshold C,, the Apriori algorithm identifies the item sets which are subsets of at least\\n\\nC transactions in the database.\\n\\nApriori uses a \"bottom up\" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as\\ncandidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no\\nfurther successful extensions are found\\n\\nApriori uses breadth-first search and a Hash tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates\\ncandidate item sets of length k from item sets of length k ‚Äî 1. Then it prunes the candidates which have an\\ninfrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent k-length\\nitem sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.\\n\\nThe pseudo code for the algorithm is given below for a transaction database T, and a support threshold of ‚Ç¨. Usual\\nset theoretic notation is employed, though note that T‚Äô is a multiset. Cy is the candidate set for level k. At each\\nstep, the algorithm is assumed to generate the candidate sets from the large item sets of the preceding level,\\nheeding the downward closure lemma. count|c] accesses a field of the data structure that represents candidate\\nset ¬¢, which is initially assumed to be zero. Many details are omitted below, usually the most important part of the\\nimplementation is the data structure used for storing the candidate sets, and counting their frequencies.\\n\\nApriori(T, ‚Ç¨)\\nL, ¬´ {large singleton itemsets}\\nko 2\\nwhile L,_, is not empty\\nC, - Generate_candidates(Ly,). k)\\nfor transactions t in T\\nD, ¬´ fe inG, : ¬¢ St}\\nfor candidates c in D,\\n\\ncount[c] + count[c] + 1\\n\\nLy ¬© fe in Cy, : count[c] > ‚Ç¨}\\n\\nke ke 1\\nreturn Union(L,) over all k\\n\\nGenerate_candidates(L, k)\\nresult -‚Äî empty_set()\\nfor all p ¬© L, q ¬© L where p and q differ in exactly one element\\neco pUq\\nif u ¬© L for all u ¬© c where Jul = k-1\\nresult.add(c)\\n\\nreturn result\\n\\n~¬´ Examples ce\\n\\nExample 1 so\\n\\nConsider the following database, where each row is a transaction and each cell is an individual item of the\\ntransaction:\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nalBle\\nalpi6\\nalBle\\nalpi6\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe association rules that can be determined from this database are the following:\\n1. 100% of sets with a also contain B\\n2. 50% of sets with a, B also have ‚Ç¨\\n3. 50% of sets with a, B also have 6\\n\\nwe can also illustrate this through a variety of examples.\\n\\nExample 2 oe\\n\\nAssume that a large supermarket tracks sales data by stock-keeping unit (SKU) for each item: each item, such as\\n\"butter\" or \"bread\", is identified by a numerical SKU. The supermarket has a database of transactions where each\\ntransaction is a set of SKUs that were bought together.\\n\\nLet the database of transactions consist of following itemsets:\\n\\n \\n\\nItemsets\\n\\n \\n\\n{1,2,3,4}\\n{12,4}\\n{1,2}\\n{2,3,4}\\n{2,3}\\n{3,4}\\n{2,4}\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWe will use Apriori to determine the frequent item sets of this database. To do this, we will say that an item set is\\nfrequent if it appears in at least 3 transactions of the database: the value 3 is the support threshold.\\n\\nThe first step of Apriori is to count up the number of occurrences, called the support, of each member item\\nseparately. By scanning the database for the first time, we obtain the following result\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nItem Support\\n{1} |3\\n\\n{2}\\n\\n{3} 4\\n\\n{4 |5\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAll the itemsets of size 1 have a support of at least 3, so they are all frequent.\\nThe next step is to generate a list of all pairs of the frequent items.\\n\\nFor example, regarding the pair {1,2}: the first table of Example 2 shows items 1 and 2 appearing together in three\\nof the itemsets; therefore, we say item {1,2} has support of three.\\n\\n \\n\\nItem Support\\n{1,2}|3\\n{1,3}|1\\n1,4} 2\\n{2,3}|3\\n{2,4})4\\n{3,4}|3\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe pairs {1,2}, {2,3}, {2,4}, and {3,4} all meet or exceed the minimum support of 3, so they are frequent. The pairs\\n{1,3} and {1,4} are not. Now, because {1,3} and {1,4} are not frequent, any larger set which contains {1,3} or {1,4}\\ncannot be frequent. In this way, we can prune sets: we will now look for frequent triples in the database, but we can\\nalready exclude all the triples that contain one of these two pairs:\\n\\n \\n\\nItem Support\\n{2,3,4}|2\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nin the example, there are no frequent triplets. {2,3,4} is below the minimal threshold, and the other triplets were\\nexcluded because they were super sets of pairs that were already below the threshold.\\n\\nWe have thus determined the frequent sets of items in the database, and illustrated how some items were not\\ncounted because one of their subsets was already known to be below the threshold.\\n\\nA Limitations &\\n\\nApriori, while historically significant, suffers from a number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned\\nother algorithms. Candidate generation generates large numbers of subsets (The algorithm attempts to load up the\\ncandidate set, with as many as possible subsets before each scan of the database). Bottom-up subset exploration\\n(essentially a breadth-first traversal of the subset lattice) finds any maximal subset S only after all 2l5| ‚Äî 1 of its\\n\\nproper subsets.\\n\\nThe algorithm scans the database too many times, which reduces the overall performance. Due to this, the\\n\\nalgorithm assumes that the database is permanently in the memory.\\n\\nAlso, both the time and space complexity of this algorithm are very high: O (27), thus exponential, where |D| is\\nthe horizontal width (the total number of items) present in the database.\\n\\nLater algorithms such as Max-Miner¬Æ) try to identify the maximal frequent item sets without enumerating their\\nsubsets, and perform \"jumps\" in the search space rather than a purely bottom-up approach.\\n\\n~ References ¬¢\\n\\n1. * Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant.Fast algorithms for mining association rules 4.

The most common form of\\ncross-validation is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and\\n\\nevaluated k times.\\n\\nHyperparameter Tuning\\n\\nHyperparameters are external configurations that are not learned from the data but significantly impact a model‚Äôs\\nperformance. Tuning these hyperparameters is a critical step in optimising a predictive model. Techniques for\\nhyperparameter tuning involve systematically adjusting the hyperparameter values to find the combination that results in\\n\\nthe best model performance.\\n\\nEnsemble Learning\\n\\nEnsemble learning involves combining predictions from multiple models to create a more robust and accurate model. The\\nidea is that by aggregating the predictions of diverse models, the weaknesses of individual models are mitigated, leading to\\nimproved overall performance. Random Forest, a popular ensemble learning method, builds multiple decision trees and\\n\\ncombines their outputs.\\nModel Interpretability\\n\\nUnderstanding the decisions made by predictive models is crucial, especially in scenarios where the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù nature of\\nsome models may pose challenges in gaining stakeholders‚Äô trust. Model interpretability techniques aim to provide insights\\n\\ninto how a model arrives at a particular prediction.\\n\\nModel Evaluation Metrics\\n\\nSelecting appropriate evaluation metrics is crucial for assessing a model‚Äôs performance accurately. The choice of metrics\\n\\ndepends on the nature of the problem‚Äîclassification, regression, or clustering‚Äîand the specific goals of the modelling\\n\\ntask.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\x0c'}, {'Screenshot_2025-07-27-06-02-15-531_com.android.chrome.jpg': \"6:02 Dom, 27/Jul @ % @-- ooo A eS 70.\\n\\n \\n\\nPagina Inici ¬© Nova guia @ Data Mininc @ TypesOf X @ Offline Dat: +\\n\\naq ‚Ç¨ > G8 pwskills.com/blog/types-of-machi yy <‚Äî @ :\\n\\n@ skitts\\n\\nHome ¬ª Data Science ¬ª Types Of Machine Learning\\n\\n \\n\\nTypes Of Machine Learning\\nBy Varun Saharawat| September 12, 2023\\nThe basic types of Machine Learning include: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Reinforcement Learning, and\\n\\nSemi-Supervised Learning.

What are the types of data models?\\n8.3. What tools are used for data modeling?\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat Is Data Modeling In Software Engineering?\\n\\nData Modeling in software engineering is the process of representing and organizing data structures in a simpler way. It\\nuses diagrams, symbols, and text to represent data and shows how they relate to each other. This process is the first\\n\\nimportant step in defining how data is structured and used in a system.\\n\\nData Modeling involves creating data models that describe how data is connected with each other. These models are then\\neventually used to build databases or update old software systems. By using data modeling, companies ensure\\nconsistency in how data is named, organized, and secured, which ultimately helps in improving their data analysis process.\\n\\nThe main focus is on making data available and well-organized to the team, regardless of how it is applied.\\n\\nTypes Of Data Models\\n\\nDesigning a database or information system starts with a simple idea and gradually becomes more detailed. Data models,\\nwhich represent the structure of the data, can be grouped into three types based on how detailed they are: conceptual,\\n\\nlogical, and physical.\\n\\nThe process usually begins with a conceptual model, then moves to a logical model, and finally ends with a physical model.\\n\\n  \\n\\nLet us understand each of these models in detail with the help of the diagram given below:\\n\\nDrowning in data?\\nWe'll teach you to swim!\\n\\nruy>iwar muucr\\n\\nDescribes the DB implementation\\naol ie Bulle\\n\\nLogical Model\\n\\nDefines the data structure\\nand how it is logically interconnected\\n\\n1] Conceptual Model\\nawa\\n\\nIdentifies business concepts\\n\\n \\n\\nTypes Of Data Models\\n\\n1. Conceptual Data Models\\n\\nThese models are also known as domain models and they basically give an overview of what the system will include, how it\\nwill be organized, and the main business rules involved. Conceptual models are created early in the project to help in\\ngathering requirements. They identify important things that need to be represented in the system, their attributes, and\\nhow they relate to each other. These models also consider security and data integrity, but they are usually simple and\\n\\nstraightforward.\\n\\n2. Logical Data Models\\n\\nLogical models are more detailed than conceptual models. They describe the data and relationships in the system more\\nprecisely, often using formal notation systems. Logical models also define data attributes, such as data types and sizes, but\\n\\nthey don't get into technical system details.\\n\\nThese models are sometimes skipped in agile or DevOps practices but are useful in projects that are data-focused, like\\n\\ndesigning data warehouses or reporting systems.\\n3. Physical Data Models\\n\\nPhysical models are the most detailed data models, they basically show how data will be stored in a database. These\\nmodels provide a final design that can be implemented as a relational database. They include tables that represent\\nrelationships between entities, along with primary and foreign keys to maintain these relationships. Physical models also\\nconsider specific database management system (DBMS) features, such as performance tuning, managing, easy storing,\\n\\nand data retrieval.\\n\\nData Modeling Process\\n\\nData modeling is a method used to understand how data is processed and stored. It involves careful planning of how data\\nwill be represented and how it will meet business needs. Different data modeling techniques use specific symbols and\\nlayouts to show how data is structured. Let us understand the basic steps involved in the data modeling process with the\\n\\nhelp of the steps written below:\\n\\n1. Identify Entities: The very first step of data modeling process is to start by identifying the key things, events, or\\nconcepts in the data set. These are called entities, and each one should be different from the others.\\n\\n2. Identify Key Properties: As we have talked above that each entity in the data set must have unique characteristics\\nknown as attributes. Your main work in this step is to find those unique attributes for an entity. For example, a\\n‚Äúcustomer‚Äù entity may have attributes like first name, last name, and phone number, while an ‚Äúaddress‚Äù entity may\\n\\ninclude a street name, city, and zip code.\\n\\nwo\\n\\n. Identify Relationships: In the next step, determine how these entities relate to each other. For example, a customer\\nmay have a permanent address and an order may be shipped to a different address labeled as ‚Äúoffice address‚Äù.\\nThese relationships are often shown using diagrams like Unified Modeling Language (UML).\\n\\n4. Map Attributes: In this step, Your job is to make sure that all attributes are properly connected to their entities.\\nThis step ensures that the data model accurately represents how the business will use the data. Various patterns\\ncan be used for this purpose depending on the needs of the business.\\n\\n5. Assign Keys and Normalize Data: In this step, you will assign unique identifiers, or keys, to link related data without\\nduplicating information. This step, known as normalization will help in reducing the storage space but may affect\\nhow quickly the data can be accessed.\\n\\n6. Finalize and Validate: Finally, In the last step, review and refine the data model to make sure it meets business\\n\\nneeds. This process should be repeated as there might be data that needs to be changed over time.\\n\\nThis approach helps in creating a clear and organized structure for data, making it easier to manage and use.\\n\\nTypes Of Data Modeling\\n\\nIn today‚Äôs time, Data modeling has evolved a lot with database systems. With the passage of time, it has become more\\ncomplex as data storage needs have grown. Here are some of the common types of data models that are widely used by\\n\\ncompanies to fulfill their needs and demands:\\n\\nRelational\\n\\nData\\nModeling\\nTechniques\\n\\n‚Äú\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\nObject\\nOriented\\n\\n1. Hierarchical data models organize data in a tree-like structure, showing one-to-many relationships. Each record has a\\nsingle root or parent that connects to one or more child tables. This model was first used in the IBM Information\\n\\nManagement System (IMS) in 1966, especially in banking.\\n\\nWhile it is less efficient as compared to newer models, it is still used in systems like Extensible Markup Language (XML)\\n\\nand geographic information systems (GIS).\\n\\n2. Relational data models were introduced by IBM researcher E.F. Codd in 1970 and are still widely used today. They\\norganize data in tables where data segments are joined, making database management simpler. Relational databases often\\nuse structured query language (SQL) to manage data. These databases are effective at maintaining data accuracy and\\n\\nreducing redundancy, making them ideal for transaction processing system.\\n\\n3. Entity-relationship (ER) data models basically use diagrams to show the relationships between entities in a database.\\n\\nData architects use ER modeling tools to create visual maps that help in designing databases.\\n\\n4. Object-oriented data models became popular in the mid-1990s with the rise of object-oriented programming. In these\\nmodels, ‚Äúobjects‚Äù represent real-world entities which are grouped into class hierarchies with associated features. Object-\\noriented databases can handle complex data relationships and are used in multimedia, hypertext databases, and other\\n\\nadvanced applications.\\n\\n5. Dimensional data models were developed by Ralph Kimball to speed up data retrieval in data warehouses. Unlike\\nrelational and ER models, which focus on efficient storage, dimensional models prioritize quick access to information, even\\n\\nif it promotes redundancy. These models are commonly used in online analytical processing (OLAP) systems.\\n\\nAdvantages Of Data Modeling\\n\\nData modeling is a key part of building software or database systems. It offers several benefits and features which include:\\n\\n1. Better Understanding of Data: Data modeling shows how data is organized and connected, which helps people in\\nmaking better decisions about how to use and store it.\\n\\n2. Better Data Quality: By finding mistakes and inconsistencies in data, data modeling improves the overall quality of\\nthe data and prevents issues.\\n\\n3. Better Collaboration: It helps everyone involved in the development process to communicate more effectively,\\nleading to better decisions and outcomes.\\n\\n4. Increased Efficiency: Data modeling makes the development process smoother by providing a clear view of the\\n\\ndata for software developers and other team members.\\n\\nData Modeling Tools\\n\\nToday, many tools help with designing and managing computer systems, these data modeling tools are available in both\\n\\nways- paid and free. Here are a few examples of data modeling tools that you can use during your development phase:\\n\\n1. erwin Data Modeler: This tool helps in creating data models in an effective way. It uses a specific method called\\nIDEF 1X but also supports other crucial methods.\\n\\n2. Enterprise Architect: This tool helps in visualizing and designing both enterprise systems and software. It follows\\nobject-oriented standards and is widely used across many industries.\\n\\n3. ER/Studio: This is a database design tool that works with many popular databases. It supports in designing of both\\nrelational and dimensional data.\\n\\n4. Open ModelSphere: This is a free, open-source tool for data modeling that is widely used by small businesses to\\nmanage their data effectively. If you are looking for a free tool to learn or understand data modeling process that\\n\\nthis tool could be the best fit for you.\\n\\x0c\"}, {'Screenshot_2025-07-27-06-23-23-548_com.android.chrome.jpg': '6:23 Dom, 27/Jul fi @ @ -- ceo 2S 68x\\n\\n \\n\\nPagina Inici ¬© Nova guia @ DataLak xX ¬© Types Of M @ Offline Dat: +\\n\\nQO ‚Ç¨ > G_ 8g pwskills.com/blog/data-lake-vs-de yy <‚Äî @¬© :\\n\\nKey Differences: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse\\n\\nThere is more to the real difference between data lake vs. data warehouse:\\n\\nA data lake accepts all types of input (structured/unstructured), while a warehouse needs to have a clean input\\n\\nstructure.\\n\\nCosts of storage: Storing large amounts in a data lake will usually be much cheaper, while warehouses can be even\\nmore expensive on account of their processing needs.\\n\\ne Users: More attractive to the data scientists, while analysts and business users will probably use the warehouse.\\n\\nUse Case: Use data lakes for predictive analysis, while data warehouses serve more for historical reporting.\\n\\ne Data Processing: Process after storage in a lake.
